	abstract = {The problem of craze failure near the tip of a crack embedded inside a craze is investigated in this work. Our micromechanics model is based on the presence of cross-tie fibrils in the craze microstructure. These cross-tie fibrils give the craze some small lateral load-bearing capacity so that they can transfer stress between the main fibrils. This load-transfer mechanism allows the normal stress on the fibrils directly ahead of the crack tip in the center of the craze to reach the breaking stress of the chains. An exact solution is obtained for the deformation field near the crack tip, and this solution is used to relate craze failure to the external loading and microstructural quantities such as the draw stress, the fibril spacing, and the chain breaking force. The relationship between energy flow to the crack tip due to external loading and the work of local fracture by fibril breakdown is also obtained. Our analysis shows that the normal stress sigma n acting on the fibrils at the crack tip increases linearly as the square root of the craze thickness assuming that the normal stress distribution is uniform and is equal to the drawing stress acting on the craze-bulk interface. However, our result shows that sigma n is very sensitive to the stress distribution at the craze-bulk interface so that the assumption of a constant draw stress acting on the craze-bulk interface ahead of the crack tip may underestimate sigma n. We also derived an approximate expression which relates the shear and tensile modulus of the crazed material to the underlying microstructural variables such as fibril spacing and fibril diameter.

The materials included fused silica, soda-lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load-displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5\%.},

As the size and stiffness of a material decrease, adhesive forces become increasingly important in determining its contact behavior. The current trends toward the use of smaller features in many areas of technology, and the importance of 'soft' materials including biological tissues, elastomers and polymer gels, demand that the effects of adhesion on contact mechanics be properly understood. The focus of this review is on the mechanics of contact experiments that are commonly used to characterize adhesion, and on the materials science of adhesion of elastic and viscoelastic materials.},

The film consisted of a layer of acrylic diblock copolymer micelles that was spun-cast onto a silicone elastomer from a suspension in butanol. A circular portion of the layer was transferred to a hemispherical glass indenter with which it was brought into contact. Transfer of the film during tensile loading of the indenter began with nucleation of a cavity at the film/elastomer interface, and was followed by delamination of the film at this interface. Statistical variations in cavity nucleation for identical loading conditions were quantified by defining a Weibull modulus similar to that used to describe the failure of brittle materials. The average energy release rate required for cavity nucleation at a fixed induction time increased with film thickness in a way that is consistent with the existence of a critical value of the hydrostatic tension at the film/substrate interface. This critical hydrostatic tension was comparable in magnitude to the elastic modulus of the substrate, and was about ten times the elastic modulus of the thin film.},

Experiments were performed using these techniques, and it is shown that large variations in local strain rate occur while necking and cold-drawing take place. A new tensile testing method is described in which the samples are tested atconstant local true strain rate. This technique is based on the use of a diameter transducer, an exponential voltage generator and a closed-loop testing machine. Flow curves for poly(vinyl chloride) and high density polyethylene were determined at room temperature over the strain rate range of 10-1 to 10-4 sec-1. It is shown that the flow behaviour of these two polymers can be approximated by the constitutive relation: $\sigma$=K.exp[($\gamma$?/2)?2].??m{\textbackslash}sigma = K {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}exp [({\textbackslash}gamma \_ {\textbackslash}in /2) {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}2 ] {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}dot {\textbackslash}in {\textasciicircum}m , whereK and$\gamma$ ? are constants andm, the rate sensitivity, is in the range 0.02 to 0.06. It is concluded that the positive curvature of the log $\sigma$ flow curve is responsible for the stabilization of flow localization associated with cold drawing, and that the rate sensitivity plays a much smaller role.},

	abstract = {A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.[1] [2]},

At the lower temperatures and higher stresses,V * decreased with increasing creep strain, $\varepsilon$, while at higher temperatures and lower stresses,V * was essentially independent of strain. The low temperature-high stress behaviour for Cu and Cu-30\% Zn was found to be consistent with the dominance of a dislocation intersection mechanism. The high temperature-low stress data for the pure metals suggest that the rate-controlling process involves the nonconservative motion of jogs on screw dislocations. For the latter conditions, an additional contribution from solute drag-limited dislocation glide also appears to be important in governing the creep behaviour of the alloy.},

The relatively high operating voltages of such actuators can be reduced by increasing the permittivity of the active material, while maintaining the mechanical properties and high electrical breakdown strength. Approaches relying on the use of highly polarizable molecules or conjugated polymers have so far provided the best results, however it has been difficult to maintain high breakdown strengths. In this work, a new approach for increasing the electrostatic energy density of a soft polymer based on molecular composites is presented, relying on chemically grafting soft gel-state $\pi$-conjugated conducting macromolecules (polyaniline (PANI)) to a flexible elastomer backbone SEBS-g-MA (poly-styrene-co-ethylene-co-butylene-co-styrene-g-maleic anhydride). The approach was found to result in composites of increased permittivity (470\% over the elastomer matrix) with hardly any reduction in breakdown strength (from 140 to 120 V $\mu$m-1), resulting in a large increase in stored electrostatic energy. This led to an improvement in the measured electromechanical response as well as in the maximum actuation strain. A transition was observed when amounts of PANI exceeded 2 vol\%, which was ascribed to the exhaustion of the MA-functionality of the SEBS-g-MA. The transition led to drastic increases in permittivity and conductivity, and a sharp drop in electrical breakdown strength. Although the transition caused further improvement of the electromechanical response, the reduction in electrical breakdown strength caused a limitation of the maximum achievable actuation strain.},

The steady-state creep rate was obtained for near-stoichiometric and vacuum-reduced compression specimens in the range 1050{\textdegree} to 1325{\textdegree}K and for stresses from 2(108) to 9(108) dynes per cm2. For a constant stress, strain, and temperature, the activation energy for creep varies continuously from 67 kcal per mole for the near-stoichiometric condition to about 33 kcal per mole for the highest degree of reduction. The activation energy for creep in hydrogen-reduced rutile is about 80 kcal per mole and this leads to the conclusion that the rate-controlling mechanism and/or defect are not the same for hydrogen- and vacuum-reduced rutile. A model based on the interaction of piled-up dislocations on a single slip system and high-density polygon walls formed during creep is proposed to explain steady-state creep in rutile.},

	abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to assess the relative merits of the free volume and entropytheories of viscous flow in glass-forming liquids by accurate measurement of viscosity over wide temperature ranges, and subsequent comparison with the equations derived from these theories. In the author\&apos;s view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropytheory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in {\textquotedblleft}viscous{\textquotedblright} liquids (shear relaxation time >=10-9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.},

	abstract = {Viscosity of Simple Soda-Silicate 500{\textdegree} to 1400{\textdegree}C Comparison of the results given by English with those of Washburn, Shelton and Libman, indicates a discrepancy in the absolute values of log10 viscosity amounting to 0.6, those of Washburn et al., being relatively too high. If correction for this is made, the isothermal curves of log10 viscosity as a function of soda content are smooth up to 50\% Na2O, showing no inflection. The observations as a function of temperature T are all represented within accidental error by an equation of the type  where all three constants vary regularly with the composition. Change of Viscosity of Glass (6SiO2, 2Na2O) due to Molecular Substitution of CaO, MgO and Al2O3 for Na2O The effect is clearly brought out by plotting (from the results of English) the change of log10$\eta$ due to the substitution as a function of temperature. The curves each show a sharp bend at a temperature between 840{\textdegree} and 1050{\textdegree}C, which is designated the aggregation temperature Ta. If we divide these curves by the corresponding percentage substituted, we get curves for each oxide which are straight and parallel below the aggregation temperatures, the slopes (increase of change of log10$\eta$ per 100{\textdegree}C) being -0.056 (CaO), -0.055 (MgO), -0.018 (A12O3) per per cent oxide substituted. For substitution of 1/2 molecule the slopes are -0.325 (CaO), -0.23 (MgO) and -0.18 (Al2O3) per 100{\textdegree}. At the aggregation temperature the change of log10$\eta$ per per cent is a minimum, 0.03 to 0.06 for CaO, 0.12 for MgO, 0.07 for Al2O3. Evidence of Aggregation in Glasses, from viscosity Measurements The sharp bends in the plots of change of log10$\eta$ due to substitution of an oxide for Na2O, suggest the beginning of molecular aggregation at these temperatures. These aggregation temperatures are close to the devitrification temperatures, but the effect on the viscosity curves cannot be due to actual devitrification since it does not change with time. Taking the aggregation temperatures as equal to devitrification temperatures, additional isotherms are roughly sketched into the equilibrium triangle of the system Na2O-CaO-SiO2. Change of Viscosity of Glass (4SiO2, 2Na2O) due to of Substitution of B2O3 for SiO2 The change of log10$\eta$ (from the results of English) is plotted as a function of temperature, and also the change of log10$\eta$ per per cent B2O3. The curves are more complex than for the substitution for Na2O.},

For one possible load configuration, the joint failure is recreated.

Examples are taken from the fatigue behavior of high strength lithium-containing aluminum alloys, aluminum alloy-aramid fiber-epoxy laminate composites, and zirconia ceramics. It is shown that, whereas crack tip shielding can provide a potent means of enhancing {\textquotedblleft}resistance{\textquotedblright} to crack growth, such extrinsic toughening mechanisms can result in the apparently anomalous behavior of {\textquotedblleft}small cracks{\textquotedblright} and to the susceptibility of brittle materials to fatigue failure.},

	abstract = {Fracking or Not Fracking? Is your home foundation in danger due to this technique used to extract underground gas? ~ The science is divided on the issue. Like on most other issues, from global warning to bigfoot, you will always find one scientist on one side and another scientist of the other of the issue. As you would expect, the businesses doing the fracking are adamant that there is no proof that fracking is causing any increases in local earthquakes or much less an increase of foundation problems for residents leaving near the fracking sites. However, the homeowners leaving with the sudden increase in slab and sheet rock cracking, have associated the foundation damage with the beginning of the fracking activity in the areas near them. Fracking is short for {\textquotedblleft}hydraulic fracturing{\textquotedblright} and as the name implies, liquids are used to fraction masses of land and rocks in the soil to release and capture natural gas. Now, without getting too technical, some geologists swear that the fracking is happening to deep in the soil for anyone to notice, while others are saying that the increase in ground shifting is directly related to such activity. It would not take a long leap to see how that could be true. In the meantime, the city of Denton could make news by becoming the FIRST town in Texas to ban fracking all together. Denton sits right on top of the Barnett Shale, believed to be one of the largest natural gas reserves in U.S. If the ban takes place, the currently operating 275 wells would continue to operate but no new ones or re-activation of old ones would be allowed. Some opponents are hopeful that the ban will {\textellipsis}},

Emphasis is placed on the relationship between structural and mechanistic features of the crystalline materials and their ion conduction properties. After describing well-established classes such as fluorite- and perovskite-based oxides, new materials and structure-types are presented. These include a variety of molybdate, gallate, apatite silicate/germanate and niobate systems, many of which contain flexible structural networks, and exhibit different defect properties and transport mechanisms to the conventional materials. It is concluded that the rich chemistry of these important systems provides diverse possibilities for developing superior ionic conductors for use as solid electrolytes in fuel cells and related applications. In most cases, a greater atomic-level understanding of the structures, defects and conduction mechanisms is achieved through a combination of experimental and computational techniques (217 references).},

In this description, the strong Coulombic interaction between an excited electron and the charged vacancy it leaves behind (a hole) is automatically taken into account. If, in an optical microcavity, the exciton{\textendash}photon interaction is strong compared to the excitonic and photonic decay rates, a second quasiparticle, the microcavity polariton, must be introduced to properly account for this coupling. Coherent, laser-like emission from polaritons has been predicted to occur when the ground-state occupancy of polaritons ngs, reaches 1 (ref. 3). This process, known as polariton lasing, can occur at thresholds much lower than required for conventional lasing. Polaritons in organic semiconductors are highly stable at room temperature, but to our knowledge, there has as yet been no report of nonlinear emission from these structures. Here, we demonstrate polariton lasing at room temperature in an organic microcavity composed of a melt-grown anthracene single crystal sandwiched between two dielectric mirrors.},

	abstract = {Tensile tests have been carried out on single crystals of anthracene over a range of temperatures and strain rates. A yield point is observed and plastic deformation occurs by slip in either the [010] or [110] directions in the basal plane. The yield point appears to be due to an initial difficulty in dislocation generation followed by a rapid multiplication of dislocations on yielding, rather than an impurity-locking effect. The critical shear stress for yielding and the appearance or non-appearance of the yield point are dependent on the surface finish of the crystals, presumably because the active dislocation sources are mainly at the surface. At temperatures less than T/TM = 0.67 for slip on (001) [010] the Peierls force appears to be a major factor in determining the critical shear stress for plastic deformation to begin, while for slip on (001) [110] the stress field due to defects probably makes a major contribution. On a effectu{\'e} des essais de traction sur des monocristaux d'anthrac{\`e}ne dans un certain domaine de temp{\'e}ratures et de vitesses de d{\'e}formation. On observe un crochet de traction; la d{\'e}formation plastique se produit par glissement dans l'une ou l'autre des directions [010] ou [110] dans le plan de base. L'origine du crochet de traction semble {\^e}tre une difficult{\'e} initiale dans la production des dislocations suivie d'une multiplication rapide des dislocations au coure de la d{\'e}formation plastique, plut{\^o}t qu'un effet de blocage par les impuret{\'e}s. La cission critique de d{\'e}formation plastique et l'apparition ou la non apparition du crochet de traction d{\'e}pendent du fini de la surface des cristaux, probablement parce que les sources actives de dislocations se trouvent principalement {\`a} la surface. A des temp{\'e}ratures inf{\'e}rieures {\`a} T/TM = 0,67, pour le glissement sur (001)[010], la force de Peierls semble {\^e}tre un facteur essentiel dans la d{\'e}termination de la cission critique n{\'e}cessaire pour provoquer la d{\'e}formation plastique, tandis que pour le glissement sur (001)[110], c'est probablement la champ de contraintes d{\`u} aux d{\'e}fauts qui donne une contribution pr{\'e}pond{\'e}rante.

Die kritische Schubspannung und das Auftreten oder Nichtauftreten der Streckgrenze h{\"a}ngen von der Oberfl{\"a}chenbehandlung des Kristalls ab, wahrscheinlich deshalb, weil die aktiven Versetzungsquellen haupts{\"a}chlich an der Oberfl{\"a}che liegen. Bei Temperaturen unterhalb T/TM = 0,67 scheint bei Abgleitung auf (001)[010] die Peierlsspannung ein wesentlicher Faktor f{\"u}r die Bestimmung der kritischen Schubspannung zu sein, w{\"a}hrend bei Abgleitung auf (001)[110] das Spannungsfeld von Gitterfehlern wahrscheinlich einen gr{\"o}$\beta$eren Beitrag liefert.},

	abstract = {Deformation twinning in HCP metals is described by a novel thermostatistical approach. Thermodynamic descriptions for the critical conditions for twin nucleation and growth are derived. These are obtained by accounting for the competition between the strain energy in the material from local stress concentrations and dislocation slip. Central to this theory is the introduction of a statistical entropy term that accounts for the energetically favourable dislocation migration paths, which determine the dynamic recovery, twin nucleation and growth rates. Deformation by dislocation slip, at strains before twinning occurs, is described by theory previously derived for FCC metals and now applied to HCP materials without additional considerations. A dislocation generation term accounting for twin propagation is added to the evolution equation. Such term becomes active once a critical strain for twin nucleation is reached. Only physical parameters are employed as input. The new theory is successful in describing work hardening and twin volume fraction evolution of Ti, Zr, Mg and Mg-based alloys for various temperature and orientation conditions.},

While adhesion and costimulatory molecules in the immunological synapse impact upon the overall force of the interaction, these results suggest that the TCR uses a force-dependent bond {\textendash} a catch bond {\textendash} and that it may therefore be important to consider the TCR{\textendash}pMHC interaction in isolation in the early phases of the decision process.

Instead G IC is more than an order of magnitude above 2$\gamma$ at M c and decreases slowly below M c. It is postulated that a small craze exists at the crack tip in such low molecular weight glassy polymers. However, since entanglements do not occur single molecules must span this craze; if they do not the craze becomes unstable and the crack advances. Under these conditions a critical craze surface displacement exists and G C can be computed to be G IC=S c($\lambda$-1) ?R 2?1/2, where $\lambda$ and S c are the craze fibril extension ratio and craze surface drawing stress observed in high molecular weight crazes (both quantities should be only weak functions of M w) and ?R 2?1/2 is the root mean square end-to-end distance of the PS molecule in the glass from neutron scattering measurements. The fracture toughness is predicted to decrease as M w 1/2 ; this prediction and the absolute magnitude of G IC are in excellent agreement with experiment.},
