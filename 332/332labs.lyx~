 class notes, textbook, or other literature for this, but be sure to cite
 appropriately.
\end_layout

What are some potential applications of this alloy and how are the mechanical
 properties relevant to these applications? Which property(ies) is(are)
 most important for the particular application?
\end_layout

The Effect of Beam Cross-sections on a Rectangular Cantilever Beam- Finite
 Element Analysis

\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Consider the elastic deformation of a beam.
 From applied mechanics, it is well-known that the cross-sectional shape
 of the beam has an important effect on its bending stiffness (
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

), or the resistance of a member to bending deformation.
 Here we will use the simplest example of a rectangular cross-sectioned
 3D beam element to compare the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and analytical
 results.

 (be reasonable please: not too much more than 5/1), keeping the area of
 the beam approximately constant, and solve for the deformation using Abaqus.
 For your report, you will address the following questions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is the deflection of the free end of the beam for your selected ratios?
 Compare to exact values from the analytical max deflection: 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{max}=\nicefrac{FL^{3}}{8EI}$

 is the area moment of inertia.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What are the stresses in the beam? Do your beams remain in the elastic regime
 under this load?

Laboratory 3: Stress Concentrators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Stresses and strains are concentrated at holes, slots, or changes of dimension
 in elastic bodies.
 Here we will use finite elements to compute local stresses near stress
 concentrators.
 We will also utilize some new FEA techniques (non-native geometries, segmentati
on, seed gradients, symmetry boundary conditions, mesh density) to analyze
 a component that was designed in an external program and used as a source
 file for a 3D printed part.
 This computational lab is in many ways analagous to the experimental exercise
 completed earlier in the course.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

The 3D-printed dog-bone specimen made from polymer proved to have non-isotropic
 tensile behavior and is too complex of a problem at this level.
 Instead, we will consider a dog-bone specimen of identical dimensions made
 of steel (elastic modulus 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\unit[209\times10^{3}]{MPa}$
\end_inset

, and a Poisson's ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=0.3$
\end_inset

.
 We will use the .SAT files to define the dimensions of the material to ASTM
 standard.
 For the stress concentrators (holes) make sure that the total extruded
 area is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[16\pi]{mm^{2}}$
\end_inset

 Use a total applied force of 10 MPa and use element type C3D8R.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The directions for this lab will be less explicit than the previous Cantilever
 Beam Lab.
 Your goal is to construct as good of a model as possible.
 You know how to construct an Abaqus simulation, but here are some tips
 for approaching this more advanced problem: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Working with Non-native Geometries:
\series default
 It's perfectly possible to reproduce the ASTM D638 Type I geometry using
 native design tools in Abaqus/CAE.
 However, you already have a .SAT file from your earlier work (available
 on Canvas in ./Computational Lab Documents/Lab #2/).
 Abaqus can read this file format.
 Simply go to

\series default

\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and browse to find the ASTM D638 Type I.SAT file.
 Rename the part as you like, and accept defaults for the Part Filter.
 Your part should appear in your workspace.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
\series bold
Modeling Forces/Boundary Conditions:
\series default
 You need not perfectly model the serrated grips' interaction with the specimen
 shoulder (although you could), but carefully consider the forces on your
 specimen when designing your boundary conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
\series bold
Symmetry Operations:
\series default
 One of the best ways to reduce computational expense is to take advantage
 of symmetry in your model.
 You can use cleverly defined symmetry conditions to reduce your mesh size
 by and arrive at the most elegant FEA solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
\series bold
Meshing Algorithms:
\series default
 The accuracy of FEA simulations are highly dependent on meshing.
 If possible, you want to avoid irregular meshes with elements that have
 high skews or low aspect ratios.
 The native dog-bone geometry, as loaded, requires a sweep mesh algorithm
 (it is yellow in the mesh module), which often works, but can lead to mesh
 defects.
 It is possible to use 
\emph on
partitioning
\emph default
 to create more regular segments that can be meshed using structural meshed
 algorithms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
\series bold
Mesh Density and Seed Gradients:
\series default
 Your results will be greatly effected by your mesh density in the regions
 of high stress (near the concentrator).
 Too coarse of a mesh will yield imprecise stress values.
 You should systematically adapt your mesh to ensure sufficient mesh density
 but (somewhat) efficient computation.
 Use of seed gradients are an excellent way to do this (hint.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
\series bold
Python Scripting (totally optional):
\series default
 Scripting can greatly speed your analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
For your write-up, please make sure to address the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe/show how the specimens deform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Describe/show the stresses in the specimen.
 Relate this to your theoretical understanding of stress concentrators as
 discussed in class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How do your stresses depend on mesh density? Note, you will have to examine
 a number of mesh densities per specimen to investigate this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What conclusions can you draw regarding the stress concentration at hole

Where do the maximum stresses occur in the specimen's long axis? 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{22}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{33}$
\end_inset

, depending on your coordinate system)? Compare the maximum value with the
 applied stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Where do the maximum stresses occur in the specimen's short axis? 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{22}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{33}$
\end_inset

, depending on your coordinate system)? Compare the maximum value with the
 applied stress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prove that your mesh density near the stress concentrators is sufficient.
 To do this, plot the maximum short-axis 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 values and long axis 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 values relative to the applied stress as a function of the number of elements
 around the hole.
 Compare these relative values with the theoretical solution for the stress
 concentration near a circular hole in an infinite plate.
\end_layout
