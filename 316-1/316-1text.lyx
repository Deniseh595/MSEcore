Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Review of the Basic Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diffusion equation describes the evolution of the composition profile
 with time as the individual components diffuse within a sample.
 These components can be either atoms or molecules, but for our purposes
 we'll assume that the diffusing species are atoms (as in a metallic sample).
 For a binary system of A and B components, we can use either 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{B}$
\end_inset

 (the respective concentrations of A and B species in atoms/volume) to describe
 the composition.
 These compositions sum to the total atomic concentration, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C_{0}=C_{A}+C_{B}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the molar volumes of A and B are equal to one another, then 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{0}$
\end_inset

 is fixed, so that the following conditions hold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_{A}}{\partial x}=-\frac{\partial C_{B}}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_{A}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial C_{B}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a binary A/B alloy we can use either 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{A}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{B}$
\end_inset

 to describe the overall composition of the alloy.

\end_inset

 is the diffusive flux of component 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 referenced to a given lattice plane in the material.
 In a binary system there are two intrinsic diffusion coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}$
\end_inset

, and two diffusive fluxes, 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The time evolution of the composition is given by the continuity condition
 that relates a change in local concentration must be related to the spatial
 derivative of the flux:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_{i}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial J_{i}}{\partial x}\label{eq:flux continuity}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the diffusion coefficient is independent of concentration (and hence,
 independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 as well) then the diffusion equation can be written as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C_{i}}{\partial t}=D_{i}\frac{\partial^{2}C_{i}}{\partial x^{2}}\label{eq:diffusion equation constant D}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diffusion equation involves a first derivative with respect to time
 an a second derivative with respect to distance, so in general we need
 an initial condition and two boundary conditions.
 Consider for example the following situation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Boundary conditions: 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}=C_{1}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow-\infty$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}=C_{2}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow-\infty$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial condition: The concentration jumps discontinuously from 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these initial and boundary conditions, the solution to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:diffusion equation constant D"

\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
C_{a}\left(x,t\right)=\frac{C_{1}+C_{2}}{2}+\frac{C_{2}-C_{1}}{2}\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{x}{\ell_{a}^{D}\left(t\right)}\right)\label{eq:erf diffusion solution}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{a}^{D}$
\end_inset

 is the following diffusion length, which enters into all diffusion problems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ell_{a}^{D}\left(t\right)=2\sqrt{D_{a}t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 To show how the concentration profile evolves with time, we have included
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{a}^{D}$
\end_inset

 in the plot.

We can also consider the situation where we have layer of material at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, which diffuses in the positive and negative directions into the bulk material.
 In this case the initial and boundary conditions are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Boundary conditions: 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\pm\infty$
\end_inset

\end_inset

, with a surface coverage (atoms/area) of

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case the following solution to the diffusion equation is obtained:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases all we need to know is the diffusion length, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{a}^{D}$
\end_inset

, in order to understand what is going on at a pretty high level of detail.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell_{a}^{D}$
\end_inset

 describes both the width of interfacial mixing for two materials that are
 brought into contact with one another (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:erf diffusion solution"

\end_inset

) and the diffusive broadening of a thin interfacial layer (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:thin film diffusion solution"

\end_inset

).
 The quantitative interpretation of the diffusion length in these two circumstan
ces is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:diffusion length"

\end_inset

.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:diffusion length"

\end_inset

a we plot the interfacial broadening for a thin layer that is diffusing
 in the positive and negative x directions.
 The width of the diffusion profile can be characterized by the half-width
 of the peak, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, evaluated at half the total peak height.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:diffusion length"

\end_inset

b we plot the concentration after bars with bulk concentrations of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}$
\end_inset

 are brought into contact with one another.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $w$

Mole Fractions and Volume Fractions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An assumption that we make throughout this text is that the atomic volumes
 of different chemical species are all identical, equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}.$
\end_inset

 In reality, this is almost never exactly true.
 Fortunately, it doesn't really matter when thinking about diffusion because
 we can always work with volume fractions instead of mole fractions.
 In a generalized formulation the molecular volumes of the A and B molecules
 are given by multiplying the reference volume by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, which is not necessarily the same for each molecule:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
V_{a}=N_{a}V_{0}\\
V_{b}=N_{b}V_{0}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can relate concentrations to mole fractions and volume fractions by consideri
ng a binary A/B system with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 total atoms.
 Of these, 
\begin_inset Formula $nX_{a}$
\end_inset

 are A atoms and 
\begin_inset Formula $nX_{b}$
\end_inset

 are B atoms.
 Multiplying by the the atomic volume gives the total volume of each component.
 The total volume of A atoms is 
\begin_inset Formula $nX_{a}N_{a}V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and the total volume of B atoms is 
\begin_inset Formula $nX_{b}N_{b}V_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 From these expressions we obtain the following for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{a}$
\end_inset

, the volume fraction of A atoms in the system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\phi_{a}=\frac{nX_{a}N_{a}V_{0}}{V_{tot}}=C_{a}N_{a}V_{0}\\
\phi_{b}=\frac{nX_{a}N_{a}V_{0}}{V_{tot}}=C_{b}N_{b}V_{0}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{tot}$
\end_inset

 is the total volume of the system.
 Note that we have used 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}=nX_{a}/V_{tot}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{b}=nX_{b}/V_{tot}$
\end_inset

.
 Throughout the rest of this text we generally assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}=N_{b}=1.$
\end_inset

 In the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}$
\end_inset

 and/or 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{b}$
\end_inset

 are not equal to one we can define renormalized concentrations, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{b}^{0}$
\end_inset

 that describe the concentration of subunits of volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}.$
\end_inset

 These fluxes are related to the atomic fluxes, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{b}$
\end_inset

 by multiplying by the appropriate value of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
C_{a}^{0}=C_{a}N_{a}=\phi_{a}/V_{0}\\
C_{b}^{0}=C_{b}N_{b}=\phi_{b}/V_{0}
\end{array}\label{eq:renormalized concentration}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The renormalized fluxes, 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{a}^{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{b}^{0}$
\end_inset

 are obtained by a similar normalization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
J_{a}^{0}=J_{a}N_{a}\\
J_{b}^{0}=J_{b}N_{b}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fick's first law still holds for these renormalized fluxes and concentrations,
 since we are just multiplying each side of Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fick's first law"

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Fick's second law applies for a similar reason.
 We can also use Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:renormalized concentration"

\end_inset

 to substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}^{0}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\phi_{i}}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}D_{i}\left(\frac{\partial\phi_{i}}{\partial x}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom line of all this is that Fick's second law still applies, with
 same diffusion coefficient used for the case where the atomic volumes are
 equal, provided that we simply replace concentrations with volume fractions.

Vacancy Diffusion Mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the output of a vacancy diffusion simulation of the interdiffusion
 between two materials.
 Vacancies move when an atom from an adjacent site moves into the vacancy.
 The resulting net motion of the atoms provides a means for diffusive mixing
 across an interface, and this is the process being illustrated in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vacancydiffusion"

\end_inset

 If the probability of hopping into a vacancy is different for A and B atoms,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|J_{a}\right|\ne\left|J_{b}\right|$
\end_inset

, and we need to consider additional effects.
 These are described below in our discussion of the Kirkendall effect.

 In the experiment a small block of brass (70% copper, 30% Zn) was surrounded
 by inert, Molybdenum (Mo) wires.
 The sample was then coated with copper, and heated to a high temperature
 to allow atoms within the material to diffuse.
 In the measurement, the distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, between the Mo markers decreased as a function of time.
 This result implies that the flux of Zn out of the brass portion of the
 sample is larger than the copper flux back into the brass from the outside.

\begin_layout Standard
Diffusion does not need to occur by a vacancy motion in order for the Kirkendall
 effect to be observed, all that is needed is an asymmetry in the diffusion
 coefficients of the individual components in the material.
 However, for our purposes we will assume for now that diffusion occurs
 by a vacancy hopping mechanism.
 This assumption is valid for the original Kirkendall experiment, and it
 also enables us to make a connection to the relevant microscopic diffusion
 mechanisms.
 It is an excellent example of the structure/property relationships that
 define the field of materials science.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our starting point is to assume that the vacancy concentration remains at
 equilibrium, so that the total number of lattice sites (including vacant
 sites) remains constant.
 A consequence of this assumption is that the fluxes of of A atoms, B atoms
 and vacancies must sum to zero: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{a}+J_{b}+J_{v}=0
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
Rearrangement of this equation, in combination with Fick's first law (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fick's first law"

\end_inset

) and the requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial C_{a}}{\partial x}=-\frac{\partial C_{b}}{\partial x}$
\end_inset

 leads to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{v}=\left(D_{a}-D_{b}\right)\frac{\partial C_{a}}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}-D_{b}>0$
\end_inset

 is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vacancy flux"

\end_inset

.
 In this case the net vacancy flux is negative (to the left), and has a
 maximum magnitude at the point where the concentration gradient is the
 largest.
 Because the vacancy flux varies with position, there will be a time dependent
 increase or decrease in the local vacancy concentration that can be obtained
 from a site conservation equation similar to Eq.

\begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
This results in a net depletion of vacancies in some regions of the sample
 (the right in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

c) and a net supersaturation of the vacancy concentration in other regions
 of the sample (the left in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vacancy flux"

\end_inset

c).
 In most cases processes exist that enable these concentration variations
 to be eliminated, by the creation of vacancies at the right portion of
 the sample and the destruction of vacancies at the left portion of the
 sample.
 Typically, these processes involve the addition or removal of vacancies
 to the core of a dislocation.

In general, a material flux, 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

, within a material can be related to a velocity, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

.
 This velocity is obtained simply by multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 by the reference volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

, that is used to define the diffusive flux: (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}=1/C_{0}$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v\,\left(\mathrm{\frac{m}{s}}\right)=J\,\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{m^{2}\cdot s}}\right)\cdot V_{0}\,\left(\mathrm{m}^{3}\right)\label{eq:velocity vs. flux}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevant velocity for us is a net, material velocity with respect to
 a set of inert markers, corresponding, for example to markers shown in
 the schematic representation of the Kirkendall experiment (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:kirkendall schematic"

\end_inset

).
 It is easy to see from this picture, that if there is a net material flux
 to the right (in the positive direction), the result will be a net motion
 of the markers to the left.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\ell}$
\end_inset

, the net velocity of the markers with respect to the ends of the samples,
 is determined by using -
\begin_inset Formula $\left(J_{a}+J_{b}\right)$

This is the velocity that individual planes are moving with respect to a

 The fluxes obtained from Fick's first law are defined in terms of a reference

\begin_inset Formula $v_{\ell}$

 We can also define fluxes of A and B atoms across stationary planes, and

 If

 towards equilibrium.
 It's not a gradient in concentration that generates the flux, it's really

This example illustrates the fact that diffusion involves more than just
 concentration gradients, but involves thermodynamic factors as well.
 In order to account for these we need to revisit Fick's first law, but
 write things in terms of the chemical potentials.
 The flux of B atoms is can be written as the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{b}$
\end_inset

 and a diffusive velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}$
\end_inset

 is the average velocity at which the B atoms are moving.
 This velocity is related to the concentration gradient by a mobility coefficien
t, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{b}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v_{b}=-M_{b}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{b}$
\end_inset

 must be positive.
 Atoms always move down a chemical potential potential gradient, although
 in some cases diffusion may take place up a concentration gradient (more
 on this in 316-2).
 We can use the previous expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{b}$
\end_inset

 to obtain the following expression for the diffusive flux of B atoms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{b}=C_{b}v_{b}=-M_{b}C_{b}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial X_{b}}\frac{\partial X_{b}}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:X and C derivatives"

\end_inset

 to write this in terms of a concentration gradient:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{b}=-M_{b}X_{b}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial X_{b}}\frac{\partial C_{b}}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing to Fick's first law (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:fick's first law"

\end_inset

), we obtain the following for 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{b}=M_{b}X_{b}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial X_{b}}\label{eq:Db vs mobility}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tracer diffusion coefficient, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}$
\end_inset

 in the dilute limit, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{b}$
\end_inset

 is dominated by the configurational entropy of mixing.
 In this limit the concentration dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{b}$
\end_inset

 is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{b}=\mu_{b}^{0}+k_{B}T\ln X_{b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the tracer diffusion coefficient for the B atoms is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{b}^{*}=k_{B}TM_{b}\label{eq:dbstar vs mobility}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by comparing Eqs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Db vs mobility"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dbstar vs mobility"

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D_{b}=\frac{D_{b}^{*}X_{b}}{k_{B}T}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial X_{b}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Composition dependent tracer diffusion coefficients can also be defined,
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 does not always correspond to the diffusion coefficient of B atoms in an
 alloy that is almost entirely made up of B.
 We can also imagine an alloy of any composition, but where we label a small
 fraction of B atoms (by isotopic substitution, for example).
 In this case the diffusing species is itself dilute, but the the alloy
 in which it is diffusing can have any composition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Summary of Diffusion in a Binary System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have defined three interrelated types diffusion coefficients: 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{D}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Here we provide a brief summary of these different diffusion coefficients
 and the relationships between them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{D}$
\end_inset

: The interdiffusion coefficient (often referred to as the mutual diffusion
 coefficient).
 If you are interested in the time-dependent evolution of the composition
 profile, this is the diffusion coefficient that you use when you are solving
 the diffusion equation:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial C_{b}}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\tilde{D}\left(C_{b}\right)\left(\frac{\partial C_{b}}{\partial x}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
note that for a binary system, we only need to specify one of the compositions,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{a}=C_{0}-C_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Also note that in general, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{D}$
\end_inset

 depends on the composition, so cannot be treated as a constant.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}$
\end_inset

: The intrinsic diffusion coefficients for the individual components.
 These are important for two reasons.
 First, they are needed if you want to describe motions of atomic planes
 relative to the external boundaries of the sample (the Kirkendall effect).
 This motion was determined from the the atomic fluxes relative to atomic
 planes, as opposed to fixed points in space.
 These fluxes are determined by the appropriate intrinsic diffusion coefficient.
 For example, for the B component, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{b}=-D_{b}\frac{\partial C_{b}}{\partial x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, predictive models of interdiffusion are generally based on the relationshi
p between these intrinsic diffusion coefficients and the interdiffusion
 coefficient through the following expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{D} & =\left[X_{b}D_{a}+X_{a}D_{b}\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

: The tracer diffusion coefficients for the individual components.
 Imagine a single atom in a homogeneous material.
 The tracer diffusion coefficient describes the probability that the atom
 has diffused a certain distance in a given period of time.
 These diffusion coefficients are purely kinetic parameters.
 Unlike the interdiffusion and intrinsic diffusion coefficients, they are
 not affected by the thermodynamics of the system.
 In general, values of the tracer diffusion coefficients will depend on
 the concentration of the material in which the tracer atoms are diffusing.
 The special cases of 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a}^{*}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{b}=1$
\end_inset

 are self diffusion coefficients.
 The intrinsic diffusion coefficients are related to the tracer diffusion
 coefficients through the following relationship:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{b}=\frac{D_{b}^{*}X_{b}}{k_{B}T}\frac{\partial\mu_{b}}{\partial X_{b}}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Diffusion in Ternary Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Atomic diffusion in ternary systems is driven by chemical potential gradients,
 just as it is does in binary systems.
 In systems with more than two components, however, the composition is no
 longer specified by a single composition variable.
 Some interesting effects can be observed in this case, as exemplified by
 carbon diffusion in Fe-Si-C ternary alloys .
 The carbon chemical potential is now a function of the concentration of
 both the silicon and carbon in the alloy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu_{c}=f\left(X_{Si},X_{C}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The diffusion coefficient of carbon is much larger than the diffusion coefficien
t for silicon (
\begin_inset Formula $D_{c}\gg D_{Si}$
\end_inset

), so we can assume that the silicon remains stationary during a diffusion
 experiment, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ternary diffusion"

\end_inset

.
 Silicon and carbon have a unfavorable thermodynamic interaction within
 the alloy, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{c}$
\end_inset

 increases with increasing silicon content, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{Si}$
\end_inset

.
 In order for the carbon chemical potential to remain constant across and
 interface between two regions of differing Si content, the carbon concentration
 in the region with low Si content needs to be smaller than the carbon concentra
tion in the region with high Si content.
 This chemical potential discontinuity at the interface is eliminated by
 the jump of carbon atoms from the left (high Si side) to the right (low
 Si side) of the interface.
 Diffusion then continues from left to right, down the carbon potential
 gradient that has been established.

\begin_layout Standard
Real crystals are never perfect, and they always contain some sort of defects.
 These defects can be classified into four categories, based on their dimension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
0-dimensional (point) defects: These include missing atoms (vacancies),
 or atoms in location where they would not be in a perfect crystal structure
 (interstitials or substitutional impurities.
 From purely thermodynamic considerations we know that point defects must
 exist at some finite concentration for temperatures above 0K.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1-dimensional (line) defects: These are dislocations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2-dimensional (planar) defects: These include grain boundaries, which are
 internal interfaces between regions of different crystalline orientation,
 and the external surfaces of a material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
3-dimensional (volume) defects: These are geometric imperfections in a material,
 like pores and cracks.
 We don't consider these types of defects in this class, but they become
 very important when we discuss the fracture properties of bulk, brittle
 materials in subsequent courses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:high diffusivity paths"

\end_inset

, dislocation, grain boundaries and surfaces are associated with a more
 open structure.
 As a result diffusion along these defects is much faster than in the bulk
 of the material.

Dislocations

\begin_layout Standard
Plastic deformation of a crystalline solid occurs by the motion of dislocations,
 which are one dimensional defects in the crystal structure.
 In general, deformation of a material occurs by shear along specified planes

 An illustration of this effect in single crystal aluminum is shown in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The material in this image is being deformed in tension, but the slip occurs

Solution:
\series default
 The critical resolved shear stress for pure, single crystal Al is 148 psi,
 so we need to figure out what tensile stress on the sample will produce
 this value for the resolved shear stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{rss}$
\end_inset

.
 The smallest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{rss}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the critical value of 148 occurs for the slip system with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\lambda=45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:resolved shear stress"

\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=2\tau_{rss}=296$
\end_inset

.
 Multiplying by the cross sectional area of the rod gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F\,\mathrm{=\left(296\,psi\right)\cdot\pi\cdot\left(0.25\,in\right)^{2}=58\,pounds}

Why is the force to deform a single crystal so low? We'll start by considering
 what we would expect for the critical resolved shear stress if the shear
 deformation were to occur by the sliding of atomic planes over one another,
 as shown conceptually in Figure

We'll start by reminding ourselves of the definition of a shear strain,
 illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In shear deformation, two parallel surfaces separated by a distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, are translated by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 with respect to one another.
 If the deformation occurs in the x-y plane, we refer to the shear strain
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{xy}$
\end_inset

, which is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

For a linearly elastic material, the shear stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{xy}$

 for the atomic planes shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The stress function has the following features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The stress is a periodic function, with the stress repeating every time
 the displacement is increased by an amount equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, the distance between atoms along the slip direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The stress is equal to zero at the stable equilibrium positions at 
\begin_inset Formula $u=0,\,b,\,2b$
\end_inset

, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For 
\begin_inset Formula $u<b/2$
\end_inset

 the stress is positive because we need to apply a stress to move the atoms
 out of their stable equilibrium positions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At 
\begin_inset Formula $u=b/2$
\end_inset

 the system is at an unstable equilibrium.
 The stress is also equal to zero at this position, but the equilibrium
 is unstable because any slight perturbation in the displacement will cause
 the atomic plane to fall back into an equilibrium position at 
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $u=b$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The maximum stress is at 
\begin_inset Formula $u=b/4$
\end_inset

 .
 The stress actually reverses sign for 
\begin_inset Formula $u>b/2$
\end_inset

 equilibrium position at 
\begin_inset Formula $u=b$

The simplest mathematical expression for the shear stress that has the right
 periodicity is a sinusoidal function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau=a\sin\left(\frac{2\pi u}{b}\right)\label{eq:sinusoidal shear stress}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we need to figure out what the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is in terms of actual material properties.
 For small displacements the material is in the linear regime, and we can
 use the definition of the shear modulus (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:shear modulus definition"

\end_inset

) to obtain the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left.\frac{d\tau}{du}\right|_{u=0}=G/d\label{eq:stress derivative}
\end{equation}

LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:sinusoidal shear stress"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $a=bG/2\pi d$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau=\frac{bG}{2\pi d}\sin\left(\frac{2\pi u}{b}\right)

The critical resolved shear stress in this picture corresponds to the maximum
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $bG/2\pi d$
\end_inset

.
 The interplanar spacing, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is comparable to 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 (We're not going to worry about the exact numerical factor here, since
 we're just aiming to get an approximate expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{crss}$
\end_inset

).
 We take 
\begin_inset Formula $b\approx d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi\approx6$
\end_inset

 to end up with the following expression for the ideal critical resolved
 shear stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{crss}^{0}$
\end_inset

, which is the value of the critical resolved shear stress we would expect
 to have if dis:

In reality, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{crss}\approx G/10^{4}$
\end_inset

, so this picture of atomic planes sliding over one another can't be correct.
 What is really going on here? The answer is that slip occurs by the motion
 of dislocations, not by the concerted motion of entire planes of atoms
 across one another.
 The concept of slip by dislocation motion can be illustrated conceptually
 by the force required to slide a carpet across a floor.
 If the friction between the rug and the floor is very high, it's going
 to be very difficult to move the rug along the floor simply by grabbing
 it from one end and pulling.
 This situation is analogous to sliding atomic planes across one another
 as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:slip of close packed planes"

\end_inset

.
 If the rug just needs to be moved a small distance it is much easier to
 create a wrinkle at one end of the rug and move it to the other end of
 the carpet.
 At the end of the process, the carpet has moved by a length equal to the
 length of extra carpet stored in the wrinkle.
 Dislocations are line defects in crystalline materials that are analogous
 to these wrinkles.

Motion of an edge dislocation is illustrated in response to an applied shear

 Note that for every atom moving away from its equilibrium on one side of
 the dislocation core, there is an equivalent atom moving toward an equilibrium
 position on the other side of the dislocation core.
 In energetic terms, for every atom that must be forced out of its lowest
 energy position, there is atom moving toward its lowest energy position.
 As a result the energy changes cancel (or very nearly so), and the energy
 barrier to moving a dislocation is much less than the barrier to slide
 surfaces across one another.
 As a result the net force to move a dislocation is very small.
 The stress needed to move a dislocation is generally much less than 
\begin_inset Formula $G/6$
\end_inset

, and is as low or lower than the observed critical resolved shear stress
 for single crystals.

 Now we introduce a formal procedure that can be used to determine the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$

 for any dislocation.

, as described here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Draw a circuit around the dislocation line that starts end ends at the same
 point.
 A 'right handed' convention is typically used to describe the direction
 that we take the circuit.
 (Clockwise looking along the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

, counterclockwise if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 is pointed at you).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Repeat the procedure, using the same numbers of atomic steps in each direction
 in a perfect crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Burgers vector is the vector connecting the start and end positions
 for the circuit drawn in the perfect crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of the procedure is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:edge dislocation burger's circuit"

\end_inset

 for an edge dislocation with an extra half plane in the top half of the
 crystal.
 The circuit around the dislocation begins and ends at point a and proceeds
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Move four steps down (a to b)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Move three steps to the right (b to c)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Move four steps up (c to d)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Move four steps to the left (d back to a)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this same procedure is repeated in the perfect crystal we end up at
 point e, which is one step to the left of our starting point at point a.
 Our convention is to define the 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 as the vector starting at point a and ending at point b.
 When the procedure is repeated for a dislocation where the half plane is
 in the bottom half of the crystal we end up with the Burgers vector pointing
 in the opposite direction, as shown in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of the Burgers circuit is a useful formalism that can always
 be used to specify the Burgers vector for a given dislocation.
 The confusing part about the procedure is that the sign of the Burgers
 vector depends on some arbitrary conventions that are not used the same
 way by everyone.
 For example, our convention is to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 as the vector linking the start to the finish of the Burgers circuit in
 the perfect crystal (linking points s to f in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Burgers circuit screw"

\end_inset

), but you can find plenty of other people who draw the vector the other
 way around (drawing 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 from point f to point s).
 Nevertheless, we remove any ambiguity by always using this 'start-to-finish'
 definition for the Burgers vector.
 Similarly, we remove ambiguity regarding the direction in which we take
 the Burgers circuit by always doing it the same way.
 In our case we use the right hand rule, directing our thumb along 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 and drawing the circuit in the direction in which our fingers are pointing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the ambiguity introduced by our definition of the direction
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 along the dislocation line is impossible to remove.
 In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Burgers circuit screw"

\end_inset

 we defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 so that it points along the negative z direction, but there's no reason
 that we couldn't have defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}$
\end_inset

 so that it is directed in the positive z direction instead.
 We end up with a Burgers vector that points in one of two opposite directions,
 depending on how we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 in the first place.
 The good news is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{n}_{d}$
\end_inset

, the vector cross product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 is independent of our convention for defining the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}$
\end_inset

.
 As a reminder, the vector cross product between vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 is defined as follows, as illustrated in Figure

 In addition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{n}_{d}$
\end_inset

 points toward the extra half plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last point is perhaps the most important one, because it provides an
 easy way to figure out how the extra half plane is oriented in an edge
 dislocation, once we specify the orientations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$

 We just use the right hand rule, cross 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$

 into

Connection to the Crystal Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Burgers vector must correspond to an atomic repeat distance in the crystal
 structure.
 As we show below, the energy of a dislocation is proportional to the square
 of the magnitude of the Burgers vector.
 For this reason the Burgers vector will correspond to closest atomic distance
 in crystal structure.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Burgers-vectors-for fcc and bcc"

\end_inset

, the Burgers vector is half the unit cell diagonal for the BCC structure,
 and half the face diagonal of the unit cell in the FCC structure.

A dislocation cannot terminate within a crystal, although it can terminate

 dislocation itself is not necessarily a straight line.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$

 is fixed, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 can change as the direction of the dislocation changes.

Solution:

For an edge we have

 We just need to figure out if the extra half plane is in the top half of
 the figure or in the bottom half of the figure in each case.

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}\times\hat{s}$

 points in the direction of the extra half plane.
 At point a 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}\times\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 points up, so the extra half plane is in the top half of the figure.
 At point c, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$

 has reversed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}\times\hat{s}$

 if the loop expands and exits the crystal on all sides?

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Solution:
\series default
 When a dislocation line moves, it introduces a net displacement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 between parts of the crystal on either side of the plane defined by the
 motion of the dislocation line.
 So if the dislocation exits the crystal, it will result net translation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 of the two parts of the crystal.
 The trick here is to figure out if the top half moves by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 or if the bottom half moves by this amount.
 In this case the top half must be shifted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 because the extra half plane at the top of the crystal ends up at the right
 edge of the crystal, and the extra half plane in the bottom part of the
 crystal ends up at the left edge.

 Slip does not require atomic diffusion, and so is not strongly temperature
 dependent.
 For an edge dislocation it occurs when the extra half plane of atoms reattaches
 to a new atomic plane, moving the half plane by a distance equal to

 As a result, screw dislocations can more easily navigate their way around

 they are moving.

 In this example an atom at the end of the extra half plane jumps into a
 vacancy.
 The net result is that the vacancy is destroyed, and the dislocation climbs
 up, away from the initial glide plane.
 Because the process requires the diffusive hopping of atoms from one site
 to another, climb is a thermally activated process that becomes more important
 at elevated temperatures.

Dislocation Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dislocation disrupts the regularity of the lattice, and introduces strain
 into the sample.
 The strain field that results from the presence of a dislocation has a
 very long range, and can easily be more than 100 times the unit cell dimension.
 As a result the total strain energy is very large as well.
 This strain field and the energy associated with it is important because
 it provides a mechanism for dislocations to interact with one another over
 long distances.
 In essence, dislocations 'talk' to each other through these strain fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Screw Dislocations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a screw dislocation we can use some simple concepts to calculate this
 strain energy, so we'll start with this example.
 Our starting point is that the material surrounding a screw dislocation
 is in a state of pure shear, with shear deformation as defined in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:shear strain"

\end_inset

.
 We see this by considering a cylindrical portion of the material around
 a screw dislocation, using the illustration in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:screw dislocation strain field"

\end_inset

.
 The displacement applied across the dislocation is given by the Burgers
 vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

 (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:screw dislocation strain field"

\end_inset

a).
 (When referring to the magnitude of the Burgers vector we'll drop the vector
 symbol and just use the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

).
 If we unwrap the circumference of the cylinder at a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 from the dislocation line (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:screw dislocation strain field"

\end_inset

b) we see that the shear displacement of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is applied over a distance of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi r$
\end_inset

.
 The cylinder has been unwrapped in the circumferential direction, 
\emph on
i.e.
 
\emph default
the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 direction, and the displacement is along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 direction so we have the following for th shear strain, 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{z\theta}$
\end_inset

:

The distortion is pure shear, with a shear strain at a radius of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

\begin{equation}
e_{z\theta}=\frac{b}{2\pi r}\label{eq:screw disloc shear stratin}

\begin_layout Standard
Note that as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\rightarrow0,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{z\theta}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The strain can't really go to infinity, so we have a problem here that
 we're going to have to deal with eventually.
 The elastic stress is obtained by multiplying by the shear modulus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{z\theta}=\frac{Gb}{2\pi r}\label{eq:shear discloc shear stress}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elastic strain energy per unit volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{v}$
\end_inset

 is obtained from the following expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{v}=\int_{0}^{e_{r\theta}}\tau_{z\theta}de_{z\theta}=\frac{G}{2}e_{z\theta}^{2}\label{eq:energy from stress strain integral}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dimensionally this makes sense, since 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 has units of force/area, or energy/volume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can combine Eqs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:screw disloc shear stratin"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:energy from stress strain integral"

\end_inset

 to obtain the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{v}=\frac{G}{2}\left(\frac{b}{2\pi r}\right)^{2}\label{eq:screw dislocation Ev}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the total dislocation energy for the screw dislocation, which we
 refer to as, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}$
\end_inset

, we need to integrate for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 (from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

), all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the length of the dislocation), and all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{h}\int_{0}^{^{r_{max}}}E_{v}\left(\theta,z,r\right)d\theta dzdr
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our case the system is radially symmetric, with an energy density that
 depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 but not on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 So we get a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 from the integration over 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 from the integral over 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}=2\pi h\int_{0}^{r_{max}}E_{v}\left(r\right)dr
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{v}$
\end_inset

 from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:screw dislocation Ev"

\end_inset

 into this equation gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}=\frac{Gb^{2}h}{4\pi}{\displaystyle {\displaystyle \int_{0}^{r_{max}}}\frac{1}{r}dr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After integration we obtain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}=\frac{Gb^{2}h}{4\pi}{\displaystyle \left[\ln r_{max}-\ln0\right]}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have a problem here because 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln0=-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This is because for 
\begin_inset Formula $r\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, the shear strain goes to infinity and we can no longer use the simple,
 continuum picture of linear elasticity to describe what is going on.
 Instead what we typically do is separate out a core energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}^{core}$
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the strain energy inside some small core radius, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 We do this simply be adding 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}^{core}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}$
\end_inset

 and replacing the lower bound on the integration from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{o}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}=E_{s}^{core}+\frac{Gb^{2}h}{4\pi}{\displaystyle \ln\left(\frac{r_{max}}{r_{0}}\right)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can generally choose 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 so that it is large enough so that our assumption of linear elasticity
 holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $r>r_{0}$
\end_inset

, yet it is small enough so that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}^{core}$
\end_inset

 is a relatively small fraction of the overall dislocation energy.
 In this case we can ignore the core energy and approximate the dislocation
 energy as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}\approx\frac{Gb^{2}h}{4\pi}{\displaystyle \ln\left(\frac{r_{max}}{r_{0}}\right)}\label{eq:screw dislocation energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edge Dislocations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stress field for an this case is much more complicated, as illustrated
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:edge dislocation stress fields"

\end_inset

.
 The distinctive features of the strain field are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the slip plane itself the material is in a state of pure shear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Above the slip plane there is compressive component to the strain field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Below the slip plane there is a tensile component to the strain field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more detailed calculation shows that the strain still decays as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

, with an expression for the edge dislocation energy per length that is
 similar to the expression obtained for a screw dislocation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}\approx\frac{Gb^{2}h}{4\pi\left(1-\nu\right)}\ln\left(\frac{r_{max}}{r_{0}}\right)\label{eq:edge dislocatioon energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 is Poisson's ratio.
 Typically 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.3$
\end_inset

 for most metals.

General Comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following general comments are valid for edge, screw and mixed dislocations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Elastic strain energy scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln r$
\end_inset

 so it has a very long range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The boundary conditions matter, so the energy depends on the shape of the
 sample.
 A small crystal with low value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{max}$
\end_inset

 will have a lower dislocation energy than a large crystal with a very large
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{max}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Energy scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Dislocations with small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are therefore preferred, which is why the Burgers vector in a material
 corresponds to the smallest interatomic spacing in the material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Energy scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 Energy is proportional to the length of the dislocation.
 This means the strain energy will decreases as the line length decreases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last point seems trivial at first, but it has some important consequences.
 Consider for example a dislocation loop.
 If the radius of a circular loop decreases, the energy associated with
 the loop will decrease as well.
 There's a line tension acting on the loop causing it to contract.
 This tension is like the tension in a rubber band that once to squeeze
 things inward, and can be viewed as a driving force for the dislocation
 loop to shrink in size.
 An applied stress can cause a dislocation loop to grow instead of shrink,
 and this will be considered later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's compare some numbers to see how the dislocation energy compares to
 the energy of other defects, like vacancies, for example.
 To do this we'll estimate the energy per atomic length along a screw dislocatio
n line by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $h=b$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:screw dislocation energy"

\end_inset

.
 We'll also assume typical values for the other parameters in the expression
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{s}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

=0.3 nm, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}=1$
\end_inset

nm.
 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{max}=1\,\mu m$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G=3x10^{10}$
\end_inset

 Pa:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{s}\approx\frac{Gb^{3}}{4\pi}{\displaystyle \ln\left(\frac{r_{max}}{r_{0}}\right)=\mathrm{\frac{\left(3x10^{10}\,Pa\right)\left(3x10^{-10}\,m\right)^{3}}{4\pi}\ln\left(\frac{1000\,nm}{1\,nm}\right)=4.5x10^{-19}\,J}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more convenient energy scale on an atomic basis is the electron volt,
 which we obtain from the energy in Joules by dividing by the electron charge
 (1.6x10
\begin_inset Formula $^{-19}$
\end_inset

 C).
 In these units the energy per atom along the dislocation line is 2.8 eV.
 This energy of comparable magnitude to typical vacancy formation energies
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 1eV, but is actually larger because of the nature of the long-range strain
 field that is produced around a dislocation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dislocation Line Tension
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An energy per unit length has dimensions of a force.
 The dislocation energy per unit length is therefore equivalent to a force,
 or tension, exerted by the dislocation.
 We refer to this line tension as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{s}=E_{s}/h\label{eq:dislocation line tension}

The line tension itself is a force, and it gives rise to a force per unit
 length acting perpendicular to a curved dislocation line, in the same way
 that the interfacial free energy results in a pressure difference (force
 per unit area) across a curved surface.
 The work done against this one dimensional pressure, which we refer to
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{r}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the increase in free energy associated with the increased length
 of the dislocation line.

\begin_layout Subsection
Effect of Applied Stress
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The line tension acts to decrease the area of a dislocation loop, but we
 need loops to expand in order for a material to plastically deform.
 So how does an applied stress induce a force on a dislocation? An applied
 shear stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 results in an additional force per unit length, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
 It's easiest to visualize the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 for an edge dislocation, as we illustrate in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fs for screw dislocation"

\end_inset

.
 To do this we use an energy balance.
 When the dislocation has propagated across the entire sample a total applied
 shear force, 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, results in a net translation of the material above the slip plane by an
 amount given by the Burgers vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The total work put into the system is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $Pb$
\end_inset

 (force times displacement).
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=P/w\ell$
\end_inset

 this total work is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
work=w\ell\tau b\label{eq:external work on dislocation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work goes into moving the dislocation, and must be equal to the force
 applied to the dislocation multiplied by the distance the dislocation moves
 as it translates across the sample.
 In our notation this distance is the sample width, 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, so we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
work=F_{s}^{\tau}\ell w\label{eq:work to move dislocation in terms of Fs}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equating these two expressions for the work gives:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{s}^{\tau}=\tau b\label{eq:dislocation force}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the force per unit length acting on the dislocation is simply the shear
 stress multiplied by the magnitude of the Burgers vector.

The only real assumption in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dislocation force"

\end_inset

 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the component of the shear stress oriented along the direction of the
 Burgers vector.
 The resulting force is perpendicular to the dislocation line itself, regardless
 of the specific orientation of the dislocation line.
 This point as an important one that is not completely obvious, so we illustrate
 it for a screw dislocation in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fs for screw dislocation"

\end_inset

.
 The orientation of the Burgers vector is identical to that of the Burgers
 vector for the edge dislocation in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fs for edge dislocation"

\end_inset

, but the dislocation is now a screw dislocation oriented along the y direction
 that propagates in the negative x direction as the dislocation moves through
 the crystal.
 Because the final state of the crystal is the same as for the edge dislocation
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Fs for edge dislocation"

\end_inset

, the work done by the applied stress is still given by 
\begin_inset Formula $w\ell\tau b$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 Eq.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ref{eq:external work on dislocation}$
\end_inset

 still applies.
 The dislocation moves a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 in this case.
 Because the length of the dislocation is 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, the total force applied to the dislocation is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}w$
\end_inset

, and the energy required to translate it by a distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}w\ell$
\end_inset

.
 So we see that Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:work to move dislocation in terms of Fs"

\end_inset

 still applies as well.
 The net result is that the 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is still given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau b$
\end_inset

, just as it was for an edge dislocation.
 It can be shown that the same must be true for a mixed dislocation as well.

Now we can look at the stress required to expand a circular dislocation
 loop.
 We'll assume that the energy/length of the dislocation is a constant.
 In other words, we are neglecting the factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\nu$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:edge dislocatioon energy"

\end_inset

 that gives a small energy difference between edge and screw dislocations.
 The total force per unit length acting on a circular dislocation loop is
 the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{r}$
\end_inset

, which acts toward the center of the loop and therefore negative, and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

, which for an appropriately aligned shear stress is positive:

At equilibrium the net force acting on the dislocation is zero (

Story about the Wright brothers airplane.
 Started out with cast Aluminum.
 Al didn't pour right when poured into the mold.
 So they added a small amount of copper.
 It was put into a sand mold, and the solid slowly cooled.
 Very small amounts of Cu precipitates were formed, which strengthened the
 alloy.
 The Wright brothers got it right be accident, but all aerospace alloys
 still contain Cu (and a bunch of other alloying elements) that form precipitate
s.

So why do precipitates strengthen a material? The answer is connected to
 Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tau star from line tension"

\end_inset

.
 Consider a dislocation that is moving toward two precipitates.
 The applied stress results in a force per unit length, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 that moves the dislocation.
 The pinning of the dislocation between the precipitates results in a curvature,
 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, with an associated stress 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{*}$
\end_inset

 that must be applied in order for the dislocation to move.
 The maximum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau^{*}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the minimum value of the dislocation curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, which is equal to half the interparticle spacing.
 For optimum strengthening, what we want very small precipitates with a
 correspondingly small interparticle spacing.

Where do these dislocations come from in the first place? Shape change associate
d with the emergence of dislocation to the exterior of the crystal must
 be decreasing their density.
 A typical dislocation density of 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx10^{7}/\mathrm{cm^{2}}$
\end_inset

 is way too small to give the experimentally measured plastic strain observed
 in a typical metal.
 So there must be some mechanism of creating new dislocations.
 One possibility we can consider is that the applied stress is itself sufficient
 to nucleate a dislocation loop.
 To figure out if this makes sense, we can calculate the shear stress required
 to expand a relatively small dislocation loop with a radius, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

\begin_inset Formula $b$

 We'll assume 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}=b$

The process by which new dislocations are produced by a Frank-Read source
 is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

.
 It is based on the behavior of a dislocation segment that is pinned between
 two points (precipitate particles for example), labeled A and B in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

.
 In the absence of an applied shear stress, this dislocation is a straight
 line between points A and B, (line 1 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

).
 As a shear stress is applied to the material the dislocation expands outward
 in a series of arcs, labeled as 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

.
 Because 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is always acting normal to the dislocation line, pushing it outward, the
 dislocation bends around the pinning points.
 Eventually, two segments of the dislocation with opposite 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{s}$
\end_inset

 are in close proximity to each other (arc 4 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

).
 These segments of the dislocation annihilate each other, and the dislocation
 breaks into two separate arcs, both of which are now labeled as 5.
 The larger of these arcs is a dislocation loop that continues to expand,
 and the smaller of the arcs repeats the process as it expands in response
 to the stress.
 In this way an unlimited number of dislocation loops can be created by
 the original segment of the dislocation.

We can also use this argument to obtain values for the critical resolved
 shear stress in the system.
 Because the shear stress needed to expand the dislocation is inversely
 proportional to the dislocation radius of curvature, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 (from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tau star from line tension"

\end_inset

), the largest stress corresponds to the smallest radius of curvature for
 the dislocation line.
 In its original unstressed configuration (line 1 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

), the dislocation is a straight line, with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Then the radius of curvature decreases as the dislocation begins to grown
 in response to the applied stress.
 The minimum radius of curvature is 
\begin_inset Formula $d/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the distance between the pinning points of the dislocation.
 This corresponds to line 1 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Frank-Read Source"

\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to the maximum applied stress, which for 
\begin_inset Formula $r=d/2$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2T_{s}/db$
\end_inset

.
 This is the critical resolved shear stress, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{CRSS}$
\end_inset

 in the material.
 If we estimate

 is repulsive.
 If they are pointing in the opposite direction, the force is negative (attracti

 Because the force scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/d$
\end_inset

 it has a very long range.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also make a qualitative argument based on the energetics to see what
 is going on.
 From Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Fs for interacting screw dislocations"

\end_inset

 we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $E\propto b^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If the dislocations have opposite signs, the dislocation come together
 and the net 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 If they have the same sign, then they form a total Burgers vector with
 a magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $2b$
\end_inset

, and an energy of 
\begin_inset Formula $4b^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So the energy is twice as large as it was originally.
 The energy as a function of separation must look the plot shown in Figure

.
 If the energy of each individual dislocation is 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $d\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $d=0$

 for dislocations of the same sign.

Screw dislocations are easy to think about because the stress field is axially
 symmetric about the dislocation line, and the stress field is always pure
 shear.
 We already know from our previous discussion of stress fields that edge
 dislocations are more complicated.
 A simple limiting case involves two edge dislocations on the same slip
 plane, since within the slip plane we are in a state of pure shear.
 In this case the discussion from the previous section is still valid, and
 we get the following expression for the interaction force:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{s}^{\tau}=\frac{G\vec{b}_{2}\cdot\vec{b}_{1}}{2\pi\left(1-\nu\right)d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expression is the same as the expression for the screw dislocations,
 with the extra factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\nu$
\end_inset

 that also appears in the expression for the dislocation energy for an edge
 dislocation (see Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:edge dislocatioon energy"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the two edge dislocations do not lie on the same slip plane the situation
 is more complicated, but we can still make some qualitative arguments based
 on the nature of the strain fields around the dislocations.
 Consider two edge dislocations on glide planes that are separated by a
 distance 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Overlapping-stress-fields"

\end_inset

.
 In this case the Dislocations begin to line up due to cancellation of the
 strains in the regions where these strain field overlap.
 The tensile strain induced below the upper dislocation is partially compensated
 for by the compressive strain above the lower dislocation.
 As a result the dislocations move along their respective glide planes so
 that they lie on top of one another.

 Both dislocations move in glide planes that are perpendicular to the y

 These dislocations move toward each other if the second dislocation is

 if the second dislocation is located in a region that is repulsive (+).

Dislocations can also interact with point defects or other atoms.
 The reason for this is that point defects also distort the lattice, giving
 strain fields that overlap with the strain field of a dislocation.
 This effect is easiest to visualize for edge dislocations, as illustrated
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dislocation impurity segregation"

\end_inset

.
 Substitutional impurities with different sizes than the majority component
 atoms can reduce the strain fields surrounding the dislocation by moving
 to the appropriate region near the dislocation.
 Large atoms will tend to substitute for atoms in regions where the local
 strain is tensile, and small atoms will tend to substitute for atoms in
 regions where the local strain is compressive.
 Interstitial impurities will segregate to regions of tensile stress as
 well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of this impurity segregation, dislocations collect 'clouds'
 of impurity atoms.
 For a dislocation to move, it must either break away from this atmosphere
 or move the impurity atoms along with it.
 The net result in either case is an increase in the critical resolved shear
 stress, a process referred to as

Interfaces have an energy associated with them.
 This is easiest to see in the case where there is a big structural change
 across the interface (a solid-vapor interface, for example).
 In the simple example illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:missing bonds"

\end_inset

 the atoms at the surface have fewer bonds than the atoms in the bulk of
 the material.
 The lower number of bonds implies that there is an excess energy associated
 with atoms near the surface.
 In the simple nearest neighbor picture only those atoms at the surface
 are affected.
 In most cases, however, many atoms near the surface are affected, especially
 in cases where the density and/or structure of the phases are very similar.
 For example, in a liquid/liquid system like the interface between oil and
 water, structural changes across the interface are more subtle, and the
 interface can be very wide on an atomic scale.
 If we plot the concentration of one of the components across the interface
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 phases as shown schematically in Figure

\begin_inset Formula $C^{\alpha}$

 over an interfacial region that can in some cases be many atomic dimensions
 wide.

How can we develop a generalized description of interfacial thermodynamics
 that is valid for all types of interface (crystalline, amorphous, narrow,
 broad, etc.)? Fortunately, this was done by Gibbs even before atoms were
 discovered (c.
 1880)! Our basic assumption is that all quantities vary across the interface
 in a continuous manner, like the density plot shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We need to develop the corresponding condition for the inhomogeneous interfacia
l region of finite width.
 We begin by considering the interface between two phases, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we can separate the system in to three regions:

 bulk phase regions where the properties are completely uniform, and an
 interfacial region

 Now we invoke the second law of thermodynamics which for us we word in

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

 For example, for

 we have:

\end_inset

 and the volume terms in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 disappear.
 With this assumption, and the definitions of the temperature (Eq.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now substitute these expressions for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta E^{\alpha}$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta E^{\beta}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta E^{I}$

 (a closed thermodynamic system at equilibrium).
 In our case these constraints can be written as follows:

This expression can be rearranged to the following:

 and replace the real system where the interfacial has some finite width
 with an equivalent model system where the the interface is a true surface
 with no volume.
 This model system is obtained by extending bulk phase properties all the
 way up to the fictitious location of the dividing surface,

 From Eq.

Note that this pressure equation is an additional equilibrium condition,

 pressure (and hence, the interface curvature) on the chemical potential.
 These pressure-induced chemical potential differences drive a variety of

\begin_layout Standard
Semiconductor nanowires provide a useful illustration of the importance
 of thermodynamics in modern materials synthesis, and on effects that emerge
 when the relevant length scales become very small.
 A schematic representation of Si nanowires is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Si nanowire schematic"

\end_inset

, along with an illustration of the growth process.
 Growth occurs at the interface between a gold liquid phase (where the Si
 solubility is quite high) and a solid Si phase (which has a negligible
 solubility for the gold.
 The Si-Au phase diagram is obviously relevant to this problem, and is shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Si-Au-phase-diagram"

\end_inset

.
 The problem is that this phase diagram is for bulk materials, and will
 somehow be affected by the fact that the length scales are very small.
 Nanowire diameters are typically in the range of tens of nm, and we expect
 that things might behave differently at this length scale.
 This is is one of the issues addressed in this section.

\begin_layout Standard
The equilibrium condition between the solid and liquid is obtained by equating
 the chemical potentials in the solid and liquid phase.
 For a single component system, the chemical potential on a molar basis
 (energy per mole of atoms as opposed to energy per atom) is equivalent
 to the molar free energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 What we need to do is find the temperature where the molar free energy
 of the material in the solid phase, 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{m}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the molar free energy in the liquid phase (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{m}^{\ell}$
\end_inset

): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G_{m}^{s}(T,P^{s})=G_{m}^{\ell}(T,P^{\ell})\label{eq:gms=gml for critical nucleus}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that we are interested in the case where the temperature is not necessarily
 equal to the equilibrium melting temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T\neq T_{m})$
\end_inset

.
 This temperature difference arises from the fact that the pressure in the
 solid and liquid phases differs by an amount given by the Laplace pressure
 difference, 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{s}-P^{\ell}=2\gamma/R$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that the differences between 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}$
\end_inset

 and between 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{s}$
\end_inset

 terms in Taylor series expansions for

\begin_layout Standard
The enthalpy of melting, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H_{m}$
\end_inset

, is a more intuitive quantity than the entropy of melting, and is more
 directly measured experimentally.
 At equilibrium for an interface between solid and liquid with a planar
 interface (so the pressure is the same in both phases), the free energies
 of the solid and liquid are equal to one another.
 This fact is generally used to write thermodynamic quantities in terms
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H_{m}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 We begin by recognizing that the free energy change between solid and liquid
 phases is zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=T_{m}:$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{m}(T_{m})=\Delta H_{m}-T_{m}\Delta S_{m}=0

\begin_layout Standard
We can use this equation to write the entropy of mixing in terms of the
 enthalpy of mixing and the equilibrium melting temperature: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the melting point depression can therefore be rewritten in the following
 way:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{m}-T=\frac{\left(P^{s}-P^{l}\right)V_{m}^{s}T_{m}}{\Delta H_{m}}\label{eq:ps-pl enthalpy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, with 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{s}-P^{\ell}=2\gamma_{s\ell}/r$
\end_inset

 we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Surface energy of a close packed plane
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use the 'missing bond' picture of crystalline surfaces to estimate
 the surface energy for a close packed plane of atoms.
 Consider, for example a {111} surface in the FCC crystal structure.
 The FCC crystal structure consists of ABC stacking of these close-packed
 planes.
 Consider an atome within one of the 'B' planes within the bulk crystal
 structure.
 Each atom within this close-packed plane has 12 nearest neighbors: 6 in
 same 'B' plane, 3 in the 'A' plane below, 3 in the 'C' plane above.
 Now suppose that this 'B' plane represents the crystal surface.
 We have removed the three bonds to the atoms in the 'C' layer, so that
 we have lost the energy associated with 3 of the 12 nearest neighbor bonds.
 Suppose the energy per bond is 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The bond energy/atom is 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon/2$
\end_inset

 (since the bond energy is shared between the two atoms).
 This means that every surface atom has an excess energy of 
\begin_inset Formula $3\epsilon/2$
\end_inset

 compared to the energy of an atom in the bulk of a material.
 All we need now is an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The easiest way to get this is to look at the molar

so the surface energy per atom is 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}/4N_{av}$
\end_inset

 There is also an excess entropy associated with the surface due to changes
 in the vibrations of the surface atoms, configuration entropy due to surface
 vacancies, but this is typically a small contribution to the overall surface
 free energy and is ignored in our treatment.
 The surface energy is obtained by multiplying the excess surface energy
 per atom by the surface density of atoms on the plane of interest,

\begin_layout Subsection
Orientation Dependence of the Surface Energy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand the faceting of single crystals we need to understand
 the anisotropy of the surface energy.
 The existence of this anisotropy is one of the key differences between
 a liquid and a solid.
 We can use simple bond counting arguments to understand where this anisotropy
 comes from, using drawing shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bonds on a tilted surface"

\end_inset

.
 This figure shows a square lattice of atoms with an exposed surface tilted
 by an angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with respect to one of the crystal axes.
 The only way to get this tilted surface is to add a series of atomic steps,
 each of which leaves a broken bond at the top and left surfaces.
 Consider surface of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 along the surface of the material.
 The projection of this length onto the horizontal axis is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\cos\theta$
\end_inset

 and the projection onto the vertical axis is 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\sin\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Along each of these directions the distance between broken bonds is 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, so the total number of bonds is along the length 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ell/a\right)\left(\cos\theta+\sin\theta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The number of bonds along the width of the sample (the direction perpendicular
 to the plane of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bonds on a tilted surface"

\end_inset

) is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $w/a$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is the sample width.
 The number of bonds per unit area, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{s}$
\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{s}=\frac{1}{a^{2}}\left(\cos\theta+\sin\theta\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The surface energy is obtained multiplying by the energy per bond, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon/2:$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{sv}\approx\frac{\epsilon}{2a^{2}}\left(\cos\theta+\sin\theta\right)\label{eq:gamma vs theta no ab value}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The equation is approximate because we have not accounted for any entropic
 contributions to the surface free energy.
 Also, the model of just adding up the contributions from 'missing' bonds
 neglects the tendency for the atoms at the surface to reorganize into structure
s that lower the overall free energy.
 These surface reconstructions play an important role in the surface science
 of materials

\end_inset

? Describe in terms of

 So we can plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{sv}$

 We'll give an example when we illustrate the Wulff construction in the

\begin_layout Subsection
Equilibrium Shape of Crystals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is a function of the angle, but what are the implications on the equilibrium
 shape of the crystal? We need to minimize the total surface energy subject
 to volume conservation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}\gamma ds
\]

\end_inset

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is a constant (independent of the angle), then we just need to minimize
 the overall surface area for a fixed volume.
 We get a sphere in this case.
 Now we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=f\left(\theta\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose we have two facets with surface energies of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
In the two dimensional Wulff construction the interface surface of interest
 is specified by a single variable, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 For a true, three-dimensional crystal the Wulff circle becomes a Wulff
 sphere, and we need two different angles to specify the the orientation
 on this sphere.
 In other words, we have two degrees of freedom in specifying a specific
 surface of a three-dimensional crystal.
 We commonly specify a surface by using the normal vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

, that is perpendicular to that surface.
 This surface has three components, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

, in the x, y and z directions, respectively:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{n}=\left(n_{1}\hat{x}+n_{2}\hat{y}+n_{3}\hat{z}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 is a unit vector with 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}+n_{3}^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, only two of the three components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

 are independent, so we again come to the conclusion that there are two
 degrees of freedom associated with the specification of a crystal surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to fully describe a grain boundary between two crystals we need
 to specify three additional degrees of freedom, so there are five degrees
 of freedom altogether.
 In order to illustrate these degrees of freedom, we can consider the following
 conceptual procedure for producing a grain boundary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cut the crystal along a plane specified by the unit normal to the plane,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Two degrees of freedom are associated with the specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotate one of the two halves of the crystal by 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 about an axis directed along the unit normal, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{c}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two additional degrees of freedom are used in the specification of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{c}$
\end_inset

, just as we use two degrees of freedom to specify 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The fifth and final degree of freedom is the the rotation angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that 5 different parameters are needed to specify a grain boundary
 within a given crystal means that it is impossible for us to be exhaustive
 in our treatment of the different possibilities.

 are special class of tilt boundaries with an exceptionally low energy.
 They are basically just a disruption in the stacking of the stacking of
 the layers in an FCC crystal structure, which is shown schematically in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FCC structure"

\end_inset

.
 The point here is that if we look at one of the close packed 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 111\right\} $
\end_inset

 planes, and designate the location of the atom centers as 'A', we have
 two choices for the location of the centers of the next layer, labeled
 as 'B' and 'C' in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FCC structure"

\end_inset

.
 Suppose we place the centers of the second layer of atoms at 'B'.
 We don't know if the structure is HCP or FCC until we put the third layer
 down.
 We have two choices:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The third layer goes above position 'A', so that the repeating structure
 of the stacking is ABABAB...
 This results in the FCC structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 of the stacking is ABCABCABC...
 This stacking produces the FCC structure.

It is evident that there is actually a very small difference between the
 FCC and HCP crystal structures, with the difference depending on the way
 atoms interact with other atoms two layers away.
 In other words, there is not a big difference between energies of HCP and
 FCC crystals, since the first nearest neighbors are the same.
 We need to go to the second nearest neighbors to find a difference.
 A consequence of this small energy difference is that there can often be
 small regions of HCP-like structure in an FCC crystal.
 A twin boundary can be viewed as a case where three layers HCP stacking
 exist within an FCC structure.
 An example from a recent application involving a solar cell is shown in
 Figure xx.

 Also, have a negative

 Now the fluxes in the two directions are different.
 It's clear now that there is a net flux of atoms from grain 1 to grain
 2.
 The actual flux from 1 to 2 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{1\rightarrow2}=A_{2}n_{1}\nu_{1}\exp\left(-\Delta\mu^{*}/RT\right)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flux in the backward direction (from 2 to 1) is given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{2\rightarrow1}=A_{1}n_{2}\nu_{2}\exp\left(-\left(\Delta\mu^{*}+\Delta\mu\right)/RT\right)=A_{1}n_{2}\nu_{2}\exp\left(-\Delta\mu^{*}/RT\right)\exp\left(-\Delta\mu/RT\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu=0$
\end_inset

, we have equilibrium and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1\rightarrow2}=J_{2\rightarrow1}$
\end_inset

.
 A consequence of this is that the following  
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}n_{1}\nu_{1}=A_{1}n_{2}v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu>0$
\end_inset

 the net flux is given by the difference:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{net}=J_{1\rightarrow2}-J_{2\rightarrow1}=A_{2}n_{1}v\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta\mu^{*}}{RT}\right)\left(1-\exp\left(-\Delta\mu/RT\right)\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\mu\ll RT$
\end_inset

, so we can use the approximation that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(x\right)\approx1+x$
\end_inset

 for small x.
 The expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{net}$
\end_inset

 then reduces to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
J_{net}=J_{1\rightarrow2}-J_{2\rightarrow1}=A_{2}n_{1}v\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta\mu^{*}}{RT}\right)\frac{\Delta\mu}{RT}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can get an expression for the velocity of the grain boundary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
v=J_{net}V_{m}=A_{2}n_{1}V_{m}v\exp\left(\frac{-\Delta\mu^{*}}{RT}\right)\frac{\Delta\mu}{RT}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The volume of a single crystalline sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi r^{3}/3$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

The number of individual nuclei formed per unit unit volume during some

 Each of these have a volume given by Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The total volume of crystallized material is given by integrating over
 all possible nucleus formation times:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(t)=Ṅ_{v}\intop_{0}^{t}Vol(t,\tau)d\tau=Ṅ_{v}\frac{4}{3}\pi v^{3}\int_{0}^{t}(t-\tau)^{3}d\tau=Ṅ_{v}\frac{\pi}{3}v^{3}t^{4}

This equation is only valid for short times, since it neglects the fact
 that individual crystalline regions stop growing once they impinge on one
 another.
 In reality, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 must reach an asymptotic value of 1 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\infty$

Second phase shape
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of a second phase particle is given by the Wulff construction.
 If the precipitate is fully coherent and the lattice parameters are very
 similar (no stress), then the interfacial energy is relatively isotropic
 and the precipitates are spherical.
 This situation is common in many precipitation hardened materials, like
 the Al-Cu system.
 In partially coherent precipitates the situation is much different, because
 the coherent interfaces have a much lower interfacial energy.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Wulff-construction with cusps"

\end_inset

 we show an example of the Wulff construction for a case where the interfacial
 free energy is radially symmetric with the exception of two deep cusps
 corresponding to the orientations for which coherent interfaces with the
 matrix can be formed.
 The coherent faces are flat, and the incoherent interfaces are curved.
 In addition, the aspect ratio of an equilibrium precipitate (length/width)
 is equal to the ratio of the incoherent interfacial free energy to the
 coherent interfacial free energy.

Elastic Effects

\begin_layout Standard
Precipitates may transition from coherent to incoherent as they grow because
 of the elastic energy associated with the lattice distortions imposed by
 a lattice parameter mismatch across the interface.
 Consider a spherical precipitate of phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in a matrix of phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, as illustrated schematically Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 We'll suppose for our case that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 have the same crystal structure, and that for small values of precipitate
 radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 the interfacial free energy is isotropic.
 Because the interface is coherent it includes only a chemical component
 of the interfacial free energy, which we refer to here as

In each of these cases the most important points to keep in mind are the
 following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The elastic strain energy is proportional to the volume of the precipitate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The elastic strain energy is proportional to the square of the lattice mismatch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are now in a position to compare the overall free energy of coherent
 and incoherent precipitates, and to see how each of these depend on the
 precipitate size.
 For a coherent precipitate we just need to add the elastic strain energy
 to the chemical contribution to the interfacial free energy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{coh}=4\pi r^{2}\left(\gamma_{ch}\right)+\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\frac{W_{el}}{V^{\beta}}\label{eq:coherent ppt energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incoherent precipitates have a larger value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 because we also need to account for the structural component of the interfacial
 free energy that arises for the dislocations that are present at the interface
 between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 phases.
 However, the strain energy in the bulk is reduced to zero, so have the
 following for 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{inc}$
\end_inset

, the total excess free energy of an incoherent precipitate:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{inc}=4\pi r^{2}\left(\gamma_{ch}+\gamma_{st}\right)\label{eq:incoherent ppt energy}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For suitably small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r,$
\end_inset

 the contribution to the total free energy that scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{2}$
\end_inset

 will always be more important than the contribution that scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 As a result 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{coh}$
\end_inset

 will always be less than 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{inc}$
\end_inset

 for sufficiently small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 As the precipitate grows and 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 increases, the contribution that scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{3}$
\end_inset

 will become more important, and 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{coh}$
\end_inset

 will exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{inc}$
\end_inset

.
 The two free energies are equal to one another at a critical radius, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{crit,}$
\end_inset

 which we illustrate schematically in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:coherent and incoherent ppt energies"

\end_inset

.
 Precipitates will remain coherent for sizes below 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{crit}$
\end_inset

 and will become incoherent for sizes larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{crit}$
\end_inset

.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{crit}$
\end_inset

 is the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{coh}$
\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

Effects of Elastic Anisotropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in reality, no crystalline material is completely isotropic.
 An FCC crystal, for example, is generally stiffest along the [110] directions
 and softest along [100] directions.
 This is because the linear density of atoms is highest along the [110]
 direction, where in a hard sphere model of the crystal structure the atoms
 are in contact with one another.
 As a result coherent precipitaes end up with facets perpendicular to the
 'soft' [100] directions.
 Faceting becomes more important as the precipitates grow (assuming they
 stay coherent), since the elastic contribution to the energy scales with
 the volume of the precipitate, whereas the total surface area scales with
 the 2/3 power of the volume.

Two regions of space meet at a plane, and three regions of space meet at
 a line.
 These lines are important in a variety of problems in materials science.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:threephasecontact"

\end_inset

 we consider the most general case, where the 3 regions of space are labeled
 1, 2 and 3.
 The junction between these three regions may correspond to three different
 material phases, or they may correspond to grain boundaries within a single
 phase region.
 In either case we refer to 1, 2 and 3 as 'phases', and refer to the line
 at which they meet as a '3-phase contact line'.
 The way in which the three phases meet at this contact line are specified
 by two angles.
 These two angles can be defined in a variety of ways, but we use the angles
 defined in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:threephasecontact"

\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$

, which give the orientation of the 1/3 and 2/3 boundaries with respect
 to the 1/2 boundary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 are related to the interfacial free energies of the 3 phases that meet
 at the contact line.
 Because interfaces have a contribution to the free energy that is associated
 with them, there is a thermodynamic driving force for any interface to
 shrink in area.
 As a result an interface exerts a force on the contact line along the direction
 of the interface, with a force per length of equal to the relevant interfacial
 free energy.
 At the three phase contact line three different forces, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{12}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{23}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{13}$
\end_inset

, are pulling on the contact line.
 At equilibrium the net force on the contact line is zero.
 We can obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{2}$
\end_inset

 by considering separate force balances in the directions parallel and perpendic
ular to the 1/2 interface:

 In order to determine the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$

\end_inset

in this case we need to know the following interfacial energies:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

In this case the three phase contact line is actually a junction between

 The important points are the following:
\end_layout

If the three grain boundary energies for the boundaries meeting at the contact
 line are all equal to one another,

 Here we consider the example of a thin, germanium film that is deposited
 on a silicon substrate.
 Both of these elements have the diamond cubic crystal structure, with a
 lattice parameter mismatch of about 4%.
 When an element like germanium is deposited from the vapor phase, the atoms
 land individually on the substrate as illustrated in Figure

 If the atoms have sufficient mobility, the resulting film will be determined
 by the structure that minimizes the free energy.
 For the Ge/Si system, the equilibrium structure consists of a thin, continuous
 wetting layer below isolated Ge islands.

\end_layout

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The full thickness dependence of the free energy can be understood by investigat
ing the way that these contributions contribute to the overall free energy
 as the Ge film thickness increases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{Ge}=0$
\end_inset

 the free energy is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{Si}$
\end_inset

, the surface free energy of the silicon substrate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For very thin Ge films the elastic strain energy within the Ge film does
 not contribute significantly to the strain energy, so the overall value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $W/A$
\end_inset

 is the sum of the energies of the Si/Ge and Ge/vapor interfaces.
 Because the Si/Ge interface is fully coherent for sufficiently thin Ge
 films, its interfacial free energy is just the chemical part, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ch}$
\end_inset

, so the overall free energy for very thin Ge films is 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{Ge}$
\end_inset

 + 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{Ch}$
\end_inset

.
 This free energy is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{Si}$
\end_inset

, so the system is in the wetting regime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As the film thickness increases the Ge film remains coherent, but 
\begin_inset Formula $W/A$
\end_inset

 increases linearly with thickness, according to the thickness dependence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{el}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the elastic energy exceeds the structural component of the Si/Ge interfacia
l free energy associated with the loss of full coherence, the Ge film becomes
 incoherent.
 The elastic energy 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{el}$
\end_inset

 is now large enough so that it is energetically favorable for the Si/Ge
 interface to be less coherent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For film thicknesses larger than the thickness for which 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{el}$
\end_inset

 is a minimum, a thin Ge layer with a thickness corresponding to the thickness
 at the free energy minimum will coexist with Ge droplets that are much
 thicker - the 'islands' shown in Figure
