	abstract = {A review is given on the formation mechanisms and the properties of Si/Ge nanostructures that have been synthesized by self-assembling and self-ordering during heteroepitaxy of {\textbackslash}mbox\{silicon-germanium\} alloys on single-crystal silicon substrates. The properties of electronic subbands in smooth strained Si/SiGe quantum well structures are presented as a basis for characterizing coherent Si/Ge nanostructures with free motion of carriers in a reduced number of dimensions. The low-dimensional band structure of valence band states confined in strained Si/Ge and Si/SiGe nanostructures is analysed by optical and electrical spectroscopy. The nanostructures presented were fabricated by self-assembly induced by elastic strain relaxation without applying any patterning technique. Misfit lattice strain of SiGe material deposited on Si substrates can relax by bunching of atomic surface steps with SiGe agglomeration at the step edges or by nucleation of Ge-rich islands in the Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. The size, density and composition of such Si/Ge nanostructures representing quantum wires and dots, respectively, can be tuned in a wide range by the growth parameters. Local strain fields extending into the Si host influence the nucleation and the lateral arrangement of nanostructures in subsequent layers and can be applied for self-ordering of nanostructures in the vertical as well as the lateral direction. Interband and intra-valence-band photocurrent, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as C-V and admittance measurements reveal a consistent view of the band structure in Si/Ge quantum dot structures. This is in good agreement with model calculations based on band offsets, deformation potentials and effective electron masses known from earlier studies of Si/SiGe quantum well structures. The effective valence band offsets of hole states within Si/Ge nanostructures reach about 400 meV. Typical quantization energies of about 40 meV due to lateral confinement and Coulomb charging energies up to about 15 meV were observed for holes confined in 20 nm sized Si/Ge dots. Future applications of Si/Ge nanostructures such as photodetectors with improved performance or novel functionality are discussed.},

The pair interactions are fitted on ab initio calculations of mixing energies and vacancy migration barriers at 0 K. The entropic contributions to the mixing of Fe-Cr alloys and to the vacancy formation and migration free energies are taken into account. The model reproduces the change in sign of the mixing energy with the alloy composition and gives realistic thermodynamic and kinetic properties, including an asymmetrical miscibility gap at low temperature and diffusion coefficients in good agreement with available experimental data. Simulations of short-range ordering and $\alpha$-$\alpha$' decomposition are performed at 773 and 813 K for Cr concentrations between 10\% and 50\%. They are compared with experimental kinetics based on three-dimensional atom probe and neutron scattering measurements.

	abstract = {Magnetism plays a crucial role in the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ferritic alloys. In fact, magnetism increases the solubility limit of Cr in Fe, inducing an asymmetrical phase diagram. Moreover, the phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic (F/P) iron alloys modifies to a large extent the system response to different environmental conditions by modification of the alloy diffusion properties. Indeed, experimental tracer diffusion coefficients deviate from an Arrhenius law during the F/P magnetic transition, leading to a large increase in the paramagnetic regime compared to the extrapolated value from the ferromagnetic domain. Furthermore, as the Curie temperature decreases with the Cr concentration, this evolution of the diffusion properties affects the decomposition kinetics in different ways depending on the alloy composition. An atomic diffusion model, with pair interactions that depend on the local composition and on temperature, has been developed to take into account this magnetic transition effect. The interaction model has been implemented in an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to study the diffusion coefficients and precipitation kinetics of the Fe{\textendash}Cr alloys. This model has been successfully compared to decomposition kinetic experiments for a wide range of concentrations and temperatures.},

	abstract = {We report on a strain-induced phase transformation in Ge nanowires under external shear stresses. The resulted polytype heterostructure may have great potential for photonics and thermoelectric applications. ?111?-oriented Ge nanowires with standard diamond structure (3C) undergo a phase transformation toward the hexagonal diamond phase referred as the 2H-allotrope. The phase transformation occurs heterogeneously on shear bands along the length of the nanowire. The structure meets the common phenomenological criteria of a martensitic phase transformation. This point is discussed to initiate an on going debate on the transformation mechanisms. The process results in unprecedented quasiperiodic heterostructures 3C/2H along the Ge nanowire. The thermal stability of those 2H domains is also studied under annealing up to 650 {\textdegree}C by in situ TEM.},

Comparisons between the calculated and measured diffusion coefficients show that most of the experimental information can be reproduced satisfactorily in the present work. The obtained mobility parameters can also predict reasonably the concentration profiles of the diffusion zone in binary Cu-Ni diffusion couple. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Grain-boundary strengthening (or Hall{\textendash}Petch strengthening) is a method of strengthening materials by changing their average crystallite (grain) size. It is based on the observation that grain boundaries impede dislocation movement and that the number of dislocations within a grain have an effect on how easily dislocations can traverse grain boundaries and travel from grain to grain. So, by changing grain size one can influence dislocation movement and yield strength. For example, heat treatment after plastic deformation and changing the rate of solidification are ways to alter grain size.[1]},

When a material is compressed in one direction, it usually tends to expand in the other two directions perpendicular or parallel to the direction of flow. This phenomenon is called the Poisson effect. Poisson's ratio (nu) is a measure of this effect. The Poisson ratio is the fraction (or percent) of expansion divided by the fraction (or percent) of compression, for small values of these changes.},
