Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main output of the MSEcore project is the set of pdf files accessed
 at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

msecore.northwestern.edu
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These files are generated using an open-source program called LyX (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

www.lyx.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

), a powerful and user-friendly interface for processing LaTeX files.
 All of the files that LyX operates on are stored in a repository on Github.
 These files are updated continuously by a team of students and faculty
 at Northwestern University.
 Contributors download a copy of the entire repository to their own computers,
 make changes to these files, and submit their changes for approval by the
 project coordinator (currently Prof.
 Ken Shull).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Dealing with Git and Github
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a brief outline of how to contribute to the MSE core text project.
 Much of this information is taken from a web book describing git and github

 Chapter 6 is particularly useful.
 A downloadable pdf version is also available

 and make a free account for yourself.
 For the purposes of this guide, we'll assume that your user name is simply

\end_inset

.
 In some of the example screenshots shown below, I've used shulltest as
 my username.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Login to your Github account (if you just did the previous step you may
 be logged in already).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Search for the MSEcore repository by typing MSEcore (or msecore, capitals
 don't matter for the search) in the search window at the top left of the
 github page, like so:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/search_msecore.png
	lyxscale 50
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you initiate the search, you should get a screen that looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/search_msecore_results.png
	lyxscale 50
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refer to the krshull/MSEcore repository as the 'upstream' repository.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the krshull/MSEcore link.
 This will bring up a screen that looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/mse_fork_button.png
	lyxscale 50
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the fork button at the upper right.
 This will duplicate the krshull/MSEcore repository into a new repository
 called your_github_username/MSEcore.
 This is the version of the repository that you will be able to edit and
 upload as you see fit.
 This repository is the 'origin' repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make sure you know how to enter commands from the command line window.
 This is more or less the same for PCs, Macs or Linux computers.
 Go to a directory on your computer where you want to store all files for
 the project and open a command window from that directory.
 (A bit more information about the command line is included in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:command line appendix"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Enter the following command (type everything after the dollar sign, which
 is the command prompt you should see in the command window.
 Make sure that 'your_github_username' is your own username, and NOT krshull):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/MSEcore.git
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will create a directory called MSEcore on your own computer and will
 put all the files into it.
 This MSEcore directory is the local working directory 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "working directory"
description "The local directory  on your own computer that includes all of the files associated with the MSEcore project.  The name of the working directory will be MSEcore.  In addition to a set of directories containing all of the files needed by LyX to build all of the different course pdf files, it includes a directory called .git.  This .git directory is your local git repository. "

\end_inset

 for your project.
 Now you can edit these files on your own computer, making any changes to
 the overall project that you desire to make.
 In the next subsections we talk about the procedure for merging these changes
 into the production repository so that your changes will be included.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Move into the MSEcore directory that you just made:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ cd MSEcore
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Add the upstream repository that you originally forked from by issuing the
 following command (type it in exactly this way, including 'krshull' as
 the git username):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$  git remote add upstream https://github.com/krshull/MSEcore.git
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
To make sure we have the remote repositories set up properly, run the following
 command:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git remote -v
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(The -v option here stand for 'verbose'.) The result of this command should
 look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/remote_status_check.png
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This will list the nickname of your own remote repository, which is named
 origin.
 Note that the url for the origin repository has your own username in the
 url.
 The upstream repository has krshull in the url.
 Once you get the output of the git remote -v command to look like the example
 above, you are done with the steps in this section and you don't need to
 do it all again.

Making Changes to Local Project Files and Including them in your Local Repositor
y
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have made a bunch of changes to one of the files you'll want to
 verify that a valid pdf file can still be generated by compiling the relevant
 LyX file.
 For example, if you've made some changes to some of the problems in 314,
 make sure that you can generate a clean pdf from the 314problems.lyx file.
 Once you've made all the changes you want to make, you need to follow the
 steps listed below to update the local repository in your working directory.
 You don't need to be connected to the internet to do any of this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Open a command window from your local working directory (the MSEcore directory
 created when you cloned the forked, remote repository).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run the status command to see the current status of your work:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git status
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first line will tell you what branch you are currently working on.
 If you haven't yet made any new branches, then you will be on the master
 branch of your forked version of the repository.
 With experience, you won't actually need to run this command very often,
 but it's a useful check at the beginning of the process.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:branch checkout"

\end_inset

Enter the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git checkout -b myedits
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command moves you to the branch called myedits, creating this branch
 if it doesn't already exist.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we want to update the myedits branch so that accounts for any changes
 to all the files in your working directory.
 First we account for the fact that we may have either added or deleted
 files in the working directory.
 We 'stage' these files for inclusion in the myedits branch by running the
 following command:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git add -A
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we update the myedits branch to include all of the changes to these
 files.
 We do this by running the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ git commit -a -m 'a brief description of the changes in this commit'
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The -a option means you are committing all updated files, and the -m option
 means that the subsequent part of the command (in single quotes) is the
 commit message describing what you have changed.
 Inclusion of the commit message is not optional.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Submitting Changes for Approval
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to upload your changes to your remote repository, and request
 that the changes included by included in the upstream repository.
 The steps are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Upload your changes included in your myedits branch to your own (origin)
 repository on github.
 Use the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$  git push origin myedits
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You'll be asked for your github username and password, and then your local
 information will be copied to your remote account on github.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Login to your github account.
 At the right hand of the window you'll see a list of repositories you are
 contributing to, and a list of your own repositories:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/your_repositories.png
	width 50text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the MSEcore repository link under your own list of repositories.
 You should see the myedits branch that you just pushed to this repository:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/compare and pull request.png
	lyxscale 50
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the green button at the left that says 'compare and pull request'.
 This will bring up a window that looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/pull request window.png
	lyxscale 50
	width 100text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on the create pull request button at the lower right.
 This will give you a confirmation window that looks like this.
 This is all you need to do.
 You don't need to do anything else with this window.
 At this point it is up to Prof.
 Shull to accept your change from his account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphical user interfaces or nice, but a lot of things are less confusing
 to deal with if you just type things into a command line.
 Windows, Mac and Linux systems get you to the command line in slightly
 different ways, but in each case you should end up with a window that looks
 like this: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
or
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename figures/command_line.png
	width 50text%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands are entered right after the command prompt, which is usually a
 dollar sign.
 This is what will be assumed here.
 If you have the choice to open the command window as an administrator,
 don't do it.
 It shouldn't be necessary for all of the stuff we are doing.
 Note that the command window knows what directory you are in.
 In this case the MSEcore directory on my own computer.
 This will generally be the directory that you want to be in to issue all
 of the git commands described in this manual.
