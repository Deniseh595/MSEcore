	abstract = {Fracking or Not Fracking? Is your home foundation in danger due to this technique used to extract underground gas? ~ The science is divided on the issue. Like on most other issues, from global warning to bigfoot, you will always find one scientist on one side and another scientist of the other of the issue. As you would expect, the businesses doing the fracking are adamant that there is no proof that fracking is causing any increases in local earthquakes or much less an increase of foundation problems for residents leaving near the fracking sites. However, the homeowners leaving with the sudden increase in slab and sheet rock cracking, have associated the foundation damage with the beginning of the fracking activity in the areas near them. Fracking is short for {\textquotedblleft}hydraulic fracturing{\textquotedblright} and as the name implies, liquids are used to fraction masses of land and rocks in the soil to release and capture natural gas. Now, without getting too technical, some geologists swear that the fracking is happening to deep in the soil for anyone to notice, while others are saying that the increase in ground shifting is directly related to such activity. It would not take a long leap to see how that could be true. In the meantime, the city of Denton could make news by becoming the {FIRST} town in Texas to ban fracking all together. Denton sits right on top of the Barnett Shale, believed to be one of the largest natural gas reserves in U.S. If the ban takes place, the currently operating 275 wells would continue to operate but no new ones or re-activation of old ones would be allowed. Some opponents are hopeful that the ban will {\textellipsis}},

Sources of shielding are briefly described in terms of mechanisms relying on the production of elastically constrained zones which envelop the crack (zone shielding), on the generation of wedging, bridging or sliding forces between the crack surfaces (contact shielding) and on crack path deflection and meandering. Examples are taken from the fatigue behavior of high strength lithium-containing aluminum alloys, aluminum alloy-aramid fiber-epoxy laminate composites, and zirconia ceramics. It is shown that, whereas crack tip shielding can provide a potent means of enhancing {\textquotedblleft}resistance{\textquotedblright} to crack growth, such extrinsic toughening mechanisms can result in the apparently anomalous behavior of {\textquotedblleft}small cracks{\textquotedblright} and to the susceptibility of brittle materials to fatigue failure.},

Second, on the basis of {ABAQUS} system, a finite element system, an instance made up of the rivet and two thin-walled sheet-metal parts of aluminum alloy is used to analyze and simulate the stress and deformation. What's more, a comparison is made between the results obtained by the mathematics and mechanics models and those by finite element method ({FEM}).

	abstract = {Viscosity of Simple Soda-Silicate 500{\textdegree} to 1400{\textdegree}C Comparison of the results given by English with those of Washburn, Shelton and Libman, indicates a discrepancy in the absolute values of log10 viscosity amounting to 0.6, those of Washburn et al., being relatively too high. If correction for this is made, the isothermal curves of log10 viscosity as a function of soda content are smooth up to 50\% Na2O, showing no inflection. The observations as a function of temperature T are all represented within accidental error by an equation of the type  where all three constants vary regularly with the composition. Change of Viscosity of Glass (6SiO2, 2Na2O) due to Molecular Substitution of {CaO}, {MgO} and Al2O3 for Na2O The effect is clearly brought out by plotting (from the results of English) the change of log10$\eta$ due to the substitution as a function of temperature. The curves each show a sharp bend at a temperature between 840{\textdegree} and 1050{\textdegree}C, which is designated the aggregation temperature Ta. If we divide these curves by the corresponding percentage substituted, we get curves for each oxide which are straight and parallel below the aggregation temperatures, the slopes (increase of change of log10$\eta$ per 100{\textdegree}C) being -0.056 ({CaO}), -0.055 ({MgO}), -0.018 (A12O3) per per cent oxide substituted. For substitution of 1/2 molecule the slopes are -0.325 ({CaO}), -0.23 ({MgO}) and -0.18 (Al2O3) per 100{\textdegree}. At the aggregation temperature the change of log10$\eta$ per per cent is a minimum, 0.03 to 0.06 for {CaO}, 0.12 for {MgO}, 0.07 for Al2O3. Evidence of Aggregation in Glasses, from viscosity Measurements The sharp bends in the plots of change of log10$\eta$ due to substitution of an oxide for Na2O, suggest the beginning of molecular aggregation at these temperatures. These aggregation temperatures are close to the devitrification temperatures, but the effect on the viscosity curves cannot be due to actual devitrification since it does not change with time. Taking the aggregation temperatures as equal to devitrification temperatures, additional isotherms are roughly sketched into the equilibrium triangle of the system Na2O-{CaO}-{SiO}2. Change of Viscosity of Glass (4SiO2, 2Na2O) due to of Substitution of B2O3 for {SiO}2 The change of log10$\eta$ (from the results of English) is plotted as a function of temperature, and also the change of log10$\eta$ per per cent B2O3. The curves are more complex than for the substitution for Na2O.},

	abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to assess the relative merits of the free volume and entropytheories of viscous flow in glass-forming liquids by accurate measurement of viscosity over wide temperature ranges, and subsequent comparison with the equations derived from these theories. In the author\&apos;s view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropytheory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in {\textquotedblleft}viscous{\textquotedblright} liquids (shear relaxation time >=10-9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.},

The steady-state creep rate was obtained for near-stoichiometric and vacuum-reduced compression specimens in the range 1050{\textdegree} to 1325{\textdegree}K and for stresses from 2(108) to 9(108) dynes per cm2. For a constant stress, strain, and temperature, the activation energy for creep varies continuously from 67 kcal per mole for the near-stoichiometric condition to about 33 kcal per mole for the highest degree of reduction. The activation energy for creep in hydrogen-reduced rutile is about 80 kcal per mole and this leads to the conclusion that the rate-controlling mechanism and/or defect are not the same for hydrogen- and vacuum-reduced rutile. A model based on the interaction of piled-up dislocations on a single slip system and high-density polygon walls formed during creep is proposed to explain steady-state creep in rutile.},

	abstract = {Actuators based on soft dielectric elastomers deform due to electric field induced Maxwell's stress, interacting with the mechanical properties of the material. The relatively high operating voltages of such actuators can be reduced by increasing the permittivity of the active material, while maintaining the mechanical properties and high electrical breakdown strength. Approaches relying on the use of highly polarizable molecules or conjugated polymers have so far provided the best results, however it has been difficult to maintain high breakdown strengths. In this work, a new approach for increasing the electrostatic energy density of a soft polymer based on molecular composites is presented, relying on chemically grafting soft gel-state $\pi$-conjugated conducting macromolecules (polyaniline ({PANI})) to a flexible elastomer backbone {SEBS}-g-{MA} (poly-styrene-co-ethylene-co-butylene-co-styrene-g-maleic anhydride). The approach was found to result in composites of increased permittivity (470\% over the elastomer matrix) with hardly any reduction in breakdown strength (from 140 to 120 V $\mu$m-1), resulting in a large increase in stored electrostatic energy. This led to an improvement in the measured electromechanical response as well as in the maximum actuation strain. A transition was observed when amounts of {PANI} exceeded 2 vol\%, which was ascribed to the exhaustion of the {MA}-functionality of the {SEBS}-g-{MA}. The transition led to drastic increases in permittivity and conductivity, and a sharp drop in electrical breakdown strength. Although the transition caused further improvement of the electromechanical response, the reduction in electrical breakdown strength caused a limitation of the maximum achievable actuation strain.},

Both nanocrystalline Cu and Pd are significantly stronger than conventional grain size material.

At the lower temperatures and higher stresses,V * decreased with increasing creep strain, $\varepsilon$, while at higher temperatures and lower stresses,V * was essentially independent of strain. The low temperature-high stress behaviour for Cu and Cu-30\% Zn was found to be consistent with the dominance of a dislocation intersection mechanism. The high temperature-low stress data for the pure metals suggest that the rate-controlling process involves the nonconservative motion of jogs on screw dislocations. For the latter conditions, an additional contribution from solute drag-limited dislocation glide also appears to be important in governing the creep behaviour of the alloy.},

	abstract = {A torsion spring is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.[1] [2]},

This technique is based on the use of a diameter transducer, an exponential voltage generator and a closed-loop testing machine. Flow curves for poly(vinyl chloride) and high density polyethylene were determined at room temperature over the strain rate range of 10-1 to 10-4 sec-1.

The properties of electronic subbands in smooth strained Si/{SiGe} quantum well structures are presented as a basis for characterizing coherent Si/Ge nanostructures with free motion of carriers in a reduced number of dimensions. The low-dimensional band structure of valence band states confined in strained Si/Ge and Si/{SiGe} nanostructures is analysed by optical and electrical spectroscopy. The nanostructures presented were fabricated by self-assembly induced by elastic strain relaxation without applying any patterning technique. Misfit lattice strain of {SiGe} material deposited on Si substrates can relax by bunching of atomic surface steps with {SiGe} agglomeration at the step edges or by nucleation of Ge-rich islands in the Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. The size, density and composition of such Si/Ge nanostructures representing quantum wires and dots, respectively, can be tuned in a wide range by the growth parameters. Local strain fields extending into the Si host influence the nucleation and the lateral arrangement of nanostructures in subsequent layers and can be applied for self-ordering of nanostructures in the vertical as well as the lateral direction. Interband and intra-valence-band photocurrent, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as C-V and admittance measurements reveal a consistent view of the band structure in Si/Ge quantum dot structures. This is in good agreement with model calculations based on band offsets, deformation potentials and effective electron masses known from earlier studies of Si/{SiGe} quantum well structures. The effective valence band offsets of hole states within Si/Ge nanostructures reach about 400 {meV}. Typical quantization energies of about 40 {meV} due to lateral confinement and Coulomb charging energies up to about 15 {meV} were observed for holes confined in 20 nm sized Si/Ge dots. Future applications of Si/Ge nanostructures such as photodetectors with improved performance or novel functionality are discussed.},

	abstract = {Poisson's ratio, named after Sim{\'e}on Poisson, is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain. When a material is compressed in one direction, it usually tends to expand in the other two directions perpendicular or parallel to the direction of flow. This phenomenon is called the Poisson effect. Poisson's ratio (nu) is a measure of this effect. The Poisson ratio is the fraction (or percent) of expansion divided by the fraction (or percent) of compression, for small values of these changes.},

Here we report efficient photo-generated charge separation by twin-induced one-dimensional homojunctions with type-{II} staggered band alignment, using a ternary chalcogenate, i.e. Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanorod as a model material. The quantum efficiency of solar hydrogen evolution over this photocatalyst, without noble metal loading, reaches 62\%. Unlike traditional heterojunctions, doping or combination of additional elements are not needed for the formation of this junction, which permits us to tune the band structures of semiconductors to the specific application in a more precise way. Our results highlight the power of forming long-range ordered homojunctions at the nanoscale for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications.},

The greatest swelling was obtained with n-heptane but the volume fraction, $\phi$, of the silicones in their swollen state was not significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05) in this liquid than in cyclohexane. For each grade of silicone, $\phi$ was plotted against $\delta$l, the liquid solubility parameter, for each liquid in which it was swollen. A second-order polynomial was plotted through the results; the minimum in this polynomial provided a value for the polymer solubility parameter, $\delta$p. The Flory polymer{\textendash}liquid interaction parameter, $\chi$, was calculated for the four best liquids, using Hildebrand's solubility parameter theory. An alternative method for calculating $\chi$, directly from swelling measurements, was shown to produce physically unreasonable results. The cross-link density, $\upsilon$, was calculated, from $\phi$ and $\chi$, for each grade of silicone, using the Flory{\textendash}Rehner equation. Since the values of two parameters involved in Hildebrand's theory cannot be determined reliably and because the Flory{\textendash}Rehner equation is an approximation, absolute values of $\upsilon$ cannot be obtained. However, the relative values of $\upsilon$ obtained were higher for the harder grades then for the softer grades and similarly, the grades with the higher Young's modulus had higher $\upsilon$ values.},

We have developed an approach using a lattice integral equation theory, and in this paper we demonstrate that this not only describes well the literature data on polymer mixtures but allows new insights into the behaviour of polymers and their mixtures. The characteristic parameters obtained by fitting the data have been successfully shown to be transferable from one dataset to another, to be able to correctly predict behaviour outside the experimental range of the original data and to allow meaningful comparisons to be made between different polymer mixtures.},

However, there has been difficulty in relating the data from highly permeable rigid lens materials to models predicting corneal swelling based upon the Dk/L of soft lenses. We have examined the methodology used to determine the oxygen permeability (Dk) of hard gas permeable ({HGP}) materials, and have applied a measurement technique that overcomes certain deficiencies of previous methods. A representative range of {HGP} and hydrophilic lens materials was measured. The Dk values reported here for hydrophilic materials are in close agreement with those published elsewhere. However, the Dk values of {HGP} materials were found to be substantially less than those reported previously, although the relative ranking appears to be independent of measurement technique. Possible explanations of these findings are presented.},

	abstract = {Lotrafilcon A is a biphasic biock-copolymer, comprising a highly permeable siloxane-based polymeric phase, coupled with a water phase (hydrogel phase). The high oxygen permeability of this material, and the fact that it is a hydrogel, places it outside the applicability of both the polarographic {ISO} standard and coulometric {ISO} draft standards for contact lens Dk determination. The oxygen permeability (Dk) and transmissibility (Dk/t) of lotrafilcon A lenses were determined by an adaptation of the standard coulometric method. Lenses with a thickness (t) range from 30 mu m to over 300 Crm were measured in a liquid-to-gas and a gas-to-gas configuration in an effort to combine features of the {ISO} (draft) standards to yield a valid measurement of the intrinsic material's oxygen transmission characteristics. The following results, for lotrafilcon A, are the mean values and {SE} for the oxygen permeability coefficient (Dk) determined at 34 degrees C: 140 +/- 2 barrer with water overlay (liquid-to-gas) at 2100 rpm stirring speed, 150 +/- 5 barrer with water overlay (liquid-to-gas) at "infinite" stirring speed, and 170 +/- 2 barrer without water overlay (gas-to-gas), where barrer = 10(-11) ({mlO}(2) . cm)/(sec . cm(2) . mm Hg). Clinical lenses produced from this material are expected to be in the 60 to 90 mu m thickness range, with an average center thickness of 80 mu m. Given that the Dk(material) is greater than or equal to 140 barrers, for this material, a parallel sided lens of 80 mu m central thickness would exhibit a lens transmissibility (Dk/t) of at least 170 x 10(-9) {mlO}(2)/(sec . cm(2) mm Hg) at 34 degrees C. This transmissibility is well in excess of the 87 x 10(-9) {mlO}(2)/(sec . cm(2) mm Hg) value postulated to be sufficient to prevent overnight lens-induced corneal swelling and places it in the hyper-permeable material category.},

Due to their chemical stability, high degree of proton conductivity, and remarkable mechanical properties, perfluorinated polymer electrolytes such as Nafion{\textregistered}, Aciplex{\textregistered}, Flemion{\textregistered}, and Dow membranes are some of the most promising electrolyte membranes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. A number of reviews on the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and fuel cell applications of perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have also appeared during this period. While perfluorinated polymer electrolytes have satisfactory properties for a successful fuel cell electrolyte membrane, the major drawbacks to large-scale commercial use involve cost and low proton-conductivities at high temperatures and low humidities. Presently, one of the most promising ways to obtain high performance proton-conducting polymer electrolyte membranes is the use of hydrocarbon polymers for the polymer backbone. The present review attempts for the first time to summarize the synthesis, chemical and electrochemical properties, and fuel cell applications of new proton-conducting polymer electrolytes based on hydrocarbon polymers that have been made during the past decade.},

It is found that the specific conductivity of the membranes is not only determined by the mobility of the ions, but largely also by the interaction of ions with water and with microscopic membrane channel structures. Similarly, the water transference coefficient, defined as the number of moles of water transported per Faraday through the membrane, is governed by two effects: an electrostatic effect between ion and water dipoles, and an effect due to the size of the cation. Contributions to electro-osmotic water transfer are water of hydration to cations and hydrodynamically pushed water molecules. The size of the ion compared to the channel diameter, has a major impact on the electric conductivity, but also on water transport. It is shown that hydrophilic cations can promote an enlarged hydrophilic domain in the membrane, that is accompanied by a lower membrane resistance. Criteria for designing high performance ion conducting membranes are given based on this basis.},

It is also possible to check the phase transformations of the absorbed water by differential scanning calorimetry. The water-polymer interaction depend on the polymer free volume, crystallinity, porosity, chemical structure, etc... It is known that strong interactions between water and polymer can produce important modifications of the solid polymer like swelling or crystallisation. If these interactions are not homogeneous inside the polymer matrix it may result in some "clustering" of the water molecules with formation of holes inside the polymer.

From the hydration behavior and the viscoelastic properties of Nafion{\textregistered} as a function of relative humidity {RH} and temperature T, this work provides evidence for the importance of internal pressure p as an additional degree of freedom. This is implemented into a phenomenological description of membrane swelling containing exothermal ion hydration, the entropy increase associated with the dilution of protonic defects within the aqueous domain and the effect of internal swelling pressure on the chemical potential of water as main ingredients. Since the internal pressure may be as high as 10 {MPa} (100 bar) it does not only have a significant effect on the chemical potential of water, but internal pressure gradients must also be implemented as a separate driving force for hydrodynamic water transport. The internal pressure responds to changes of the membrane's viscoelastic properties which are suggested to be different for bulk and an {\textquotedblleft}extended layered surface skin{\textquotedblright}. The latter is put forward to be very tough parallel and little permeable for water normal to the membrane surface. Changes of the anisotropic {\textquotedblleft}skin{\textquotedblright} structure in contact with liquid water are suggested to release most of the internal pressure which may provide an explanation for the improved performance of certain composites and {\textquotedblleft}Schroeder's paradox{\textquotedblright}.

The conductivity in this direction is 2 {\texttimes} 10-8 $\omega$-1 cm-1 at 25{\textdegree}C and shows an activation enthalpy of 0.75 {\textpm} 0.07 {eV}. The two-dimensional conductors {HUO}2AsO4{\textperiodcentered}4H2O and {HUO}2PO4{\textperiodcentered}4H2O were studied as a function of their water content. The conductivities are 8 {\texttimes} 10-6 and 3 {\texttimes} 10-5 $\omega$-1 cm-1 in the orthorhombic phase at -10{\textdegree}C, with activation enthalpies of 0.70 {\textpm} 0.05 and 0.57 {\textpm} 0.07 {eV}, respectively. Indications of peritectic transitions to the tetragonal phases were observed in the temperature ranges 15 to 47 and -5 to 10{\textdegree}C, respectively. The transition depends on the water content which appears to control the increase in conductivity in this material. The dependence upon various sample parameters is discussed. Fast proton transport in solids is proposed to occur by a {\textquotedblleft}vehicle mechanism{\textquotedblright}, i.e. the motion of N2H+5, H3O+- or other proton-containing groups.},

The fracture stresses at 50\% fracture probability for tensile testing and two-point bending were measured to be 4.5 and 5.1 {GPa}, respectively. Our data on tensile strength versus bending strength is consistent with the Weibull statistical nature that a larger critical crack is more likely to be found as specimen size increases. The fracture characteristics of each tested optical fiber specimen were evaluated by using an {SEM}. A critical flaw on the surface of glass fiber was found to be the fracture origin for specimens under either tension or bending as expected. Using fracture mechanics, the critical fracture flaws of optical fibers were calculated to be in nanometer size. The stripped fibers were found to be much weaker than optical fibers.

Here, we present a general strategy for combining protein modules with specified stability and function into arrays for the assembly of stimuli-responsive gels. We have designed tetratricopeptide repeat ({TPR}) arrays which contain peptide-binding modules that specify the strength and reversibility of network crosslinking in combination with spacer modules that specify crosslinking geometry and overall stability of the array. By combining such arrays with multivalent peptide ligands, self-supporting stimuli-responsive gels are formed. Using microrheology, we characterized the kinetics of gelation as a function of concentration and stoichiometry of the components. We also show that such gels are effective in encapsulating and releasing small molecules. Moreover, {TPR} gels alone are fully compatible with cell growth, whereas gels loaded with an anticancer compound release the compound, resulting in cell death. Thus, we have demonstrated that this new class of tunable biomaterials is ripe for further development as tissue engineering and drug delivery platform. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These systems use thin carbon-black-doped poly(dimethylsiloxane) ({CB}-{PDMS}) for the strain gauges due to its high resistivity and strong dependence on strain, and thick carbon-nanotube-doped {PDMS} ({CNT}-{PDMS}) for the interconnects due to its comparatively low resistivity and weak dependence on strain. Devices composed of molded, straight resistors of {CB}-{PDMS} joined by serpentine-shaped interconnects of {CNT}-{PDMS}, both in a matrix substrate of {PDMS}, have electrical responses that depend almost entirely on the strain in the {CB}-{PDMS}. Integrated structures of this type have Young's moduli of 244 {kPa}, which lies within the range of values for the human epidermis. Such sheets can be readily laminated on and form conformal contact to the human skin, with only modest mechanical constraints on natural motions.

	abstract = {Background Since articular cartilage has important mechanical properties such as load-bearing, shock absorption and lubrication for activities in daily life, it is important to evaluate the mechanical properties of repaired cartilage in terms of whether those properties are the same as those of natural cartilage. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an electrical impedance method for quantitatively measuring the mechanical properties of cartilage. Methods Cartilage specimens were harvested from porcine knee joint, and two kinds of enzyme-treated cartilages were prepared to investigate the correlation between mechanical and electrical properties resulting from changes in the structure of the extracellular matrix. Collagenase solution and hyaluronidase solution were used to digest the collagen fibril and proteoglycan, respectively. Electrical impedance measurement, indentation test and biochemical analysis were carried out for the enzyme-treated cartilages. Results The water content increased with enzyme treatment time, and the permeability of the treated cartilages increased with decreasing glycosaminoglycan content for both types of enzyme-treated cartilages. The aggregate modulus and the electrical resistivity for both types of enzyme-treated cartilages decreased with increasing permeability after 12-h treatment. The aggregate modulus and the electrical resistivity for both types of treated cartilages decreased with increasing water content and permeability after 24-h treatment. The electrical resistivity and the aggregate modulus of articular cartilage depended not only on the water content, but also on the permeability, and the electrical resistivity for both types of enzyme-treated cartilages was found to be significantly linearly correlated with the aggregate modulus. Conclusions These results showed that the aggregate modulus of articular cartilage can be estimated by measuring its electrical impedance.},

Specifically, research has focused on elucidating the role of network formation and connectivity on mechanical integrity and degradation behavior. Here, we compared the mechanical properties of chain- and step-polymerized, photodegradable hydrogels. Increased ductility, tensile toughness, and shear strain to yield were observed in step-polymerized hydrogels, as compared to the chain-polymerized gels, indicating that increased homogeneity and network cooperativity in the gel backbone improves mechanical integrity. Furthermore, the ability to degrade the hydrogels in a controlled fashion with light was exploited to explore how hydrogel microstructure influences photodegradation and erosion. Here, the decreased network connectivity at the junction points in the step-polymerized gels resulted in more rapid erosion. Finally, a relationship between the reverse gelation threshold and erosion rate was developed for the general class of photodegradable hydrogels. In all, these studies further elucidate the relationship between hydrogel formation and microarchitecture with macroscale behavior to facilitate the future design of polymer networks and degradable hydrogels, as well as photoresponsive materials such as cell culture templates, drug delivery vehicles, responsive coatings, and anisotropic materials.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Tetra-{PEG} gel has drawn much attention as a polymer gel with extremely suppressed heterogeneity, which is known as the intrinsic characteristics of polymer networks, and is difficult to control. Tetra-{PEG} gel is formed by a novel fabrication method, i.e., {AB}-type crosslink coupling, which is polycondensation between mutually reactive multi-armed polymers forming a polymer network. {AB}-type crosslink coupling has advantages on suppressing the heterogeneity over conventional polycondensation. In this review, we focused on the gelation reaction and the relationship between the mechanical properties and structure. The reaction proceeded as a simple second order reaction of A and B end-groups from the initiation to the end (approx. 90\%), suggesting the homogeneous mixing of two prepolymers. The model predicting the elastic modulus of Tetra-{PEG} gel shifts from the phantom to affine network models with an increase in polymer concentration. The fracture energy is well predicted by the Lake{\textendash}Thomas model. These experimental studies also suggest that Tetra-{PEG} gel has extremely homogeneous network structure and is a candidate material for evaluating the basic physical properties of polymer gels.},

Three different families of hyaluronic acid ({HA})-based photopolymerized {PEG} diacrylate ({PEGDA}) hydrogels were compared, using different concentrations and molecular weights (64 and 234~{kDa}) of {HA}: semi-{IPNs} containing native {HA} in a {PEG} network (type I gels); co-networks obtained using thiolated {HA} as chain transfer agent during {PEGDA} polymerization (type {II} gels); co-networks obtained from the in situ preparation of a macromonomer derived from the Michael-type addition of thiolated {HA} on {PEGDA} (type {III} gels). From a comparative study of rheological properties and enzymatic degradability, type {II} gels were selected for a further study aiming to link their mechanical properties to cell spreading. Employing {RGD}-functionalized materials, Young{\textquoteright}s moduli were measured via {AFM} nanoindentation while the cell spreading behavior was quantitatively evaluated by monitoring morphology and metabolic activity ({MTS} assay) of L929 fibroblasts.

We describe a biosynthetic hybrid scaffold comprised of a fibrinogen backbone and crosslinked with difunctional polyethylene glycol ({PEG}) side chains. Denatured fibrinogen fragments are {PEGylated} with {PEG}-diacrylates, mixed with photoinitiator and exposed to {UV} light to form a hydrogel material in the presence of a cell suspension. This unique hydrogel material provides a distinct advantage over other scaffold materials because its mechanical properties are highly malleable while the biological functionality is maintained by the backbone of the polymeric network. The elastic modulus of the {PEG}-fibrinogen hydrogel is dependent on the molecular weight of the {PEG} constituent and proportional to the percent polymeric composition. The biological domains in the fibrinogen backbone provide attachment motifs for endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell adhesion as well as proteolytic sensitivity for biodegradation. Smooth muscle cells demonstrate the ability to proteolytically penetrate through the hydrogel material and form interconnecting networks of cells. Our efforts to develop novel biodegradable scaffolds for cultivating cells in a 3D environment are beneficial for tissue regeneration therapies.},

	abstract = {The effect on stiffness and debonding of an interphase zone of altered polymer properties surrounding each carbon nanotube ({CNT}) in a {CNT} reinforced polymer composite is investigated. The interphase zone has position dependent material properties that merge with those of the polymer at a sufficiently large distance from the inclusion. There is evidence that such an interphase zone must be included in models in order to represent the overall composite properties. The analyses are based on an axisymmetric unit cell model of the composite. An elastic{\textendash}viscoplastic conventional continuum constitutive relation (a size-independent relation between stress, strain and strain rate) is taken to characterize the bulk polymer material and the interphase, with the material properties being position dependent in the interphase. The interface between the polymer and the {CNT} is modeled by a phenomenological cohesive relation that allows for complete separation and the creation of new free surface. The effect of varying interface strength on the composite stress{\textendash}strain response and on debonding is analyzed both with and without an interphase. The presence of an interphase increases the composite stiffness but promotes debonding which ultimately reduces composite stress carrying capacity. The compliance of the interface also affects the stress{\textendash}strain response prior to debonding and leads to stress redistributions within both the fiber and the matrix (and/or interphase) which can affect the fracture mode that occurs.},

Typically, description of polymer nanocomposites for microstructure generation is difficult given the high degrees of freedom inherent in the location of each nanoparticle. The lack of true microstructure utilization hinders our ability to understand the interaction between the nanoparticle and polymer, which cannot easily be deconvoluted from experiments alone. We consider here a material system of carbon black particle fillers dispersed in synthetic natural rubber. Scanning Electron Microscope ({SEM}) images are first taken of these carbon black-rubber composites samples and then transformed into binary images. The binary images from either a microscope image of original specimens or microstructure reconstruction according to the material statistical description are used as geometric inputs for the finite element model along with experimentally determined viscoelastic properties of pure rubber. Simulations on the viscoelastic properties of the rubber composites are performed through {ABAQUS}. The simulated results are then compared with composite viscoelastic data in both frequency and temperature domains. The comparison shows that for the specific rubber/{CB} composite discussed in this paper, the thickness being 25. nm and relaxation time being 32 times that of matrix polymer provide the best approximations for the properties of interfacial polymer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mechanochemical transduction enables an extraordinary range of physiological processes such as the sense of touch, hearing, balance, muscle contraction, and the growth and remodelling of tissue and bone. Although biology is replete with materials systems that actively and functionally respond to mechanical stimuli, the default mechanochemical reaction of bulk polymers to large external stress is the unselective scission of covalent bonds, resulting in damage or failure. An alternative to this degradation process is the rational molecular design of synthetic materials such that mechanical stress favourably alters material properties. A few mechanosensitive polymers with this property have been developed; but their active response is mediated through non-covalent processes, which may limit the extent to which properties can be modified and the long-term stability in structural materials. Previously, we have shown with dissolved polymer strands incorporating mechanically sensitive chemical groups{\textemdash}so-called mechanophores{\textemdash}that the directional nature of mechanical forces can selectively break and re-form covalent bonds. We now demonstrate that such force-induced covalent-bond activation can also be realized with mechanophore-linked elastomeric and glassy polymers, by using a mechanophore that changes colour as it undergoes a reversible electrocyclic ring-opening reaction under tensile stress and thus allows us to directly and locally visualize the mechanochemical reaction. We find that pronounced changes in colour and fluorescence emerge with the accumulation of plastic deformation, indicating that in these polymeric materials the transduction of mechanical force into the ring-opening reaction is an activated process. We anticipate that force activation of covalent bonds can serve as a general strategy for the development of new mechanophore building blocks that impart polymeric materials with desirable functionalities ranging from damage sensing to fully regenerative self-healing.},

	abstract = {Bio-inspired assembly of platelet particles and polyelectrolytes into ordered layered nanocomposites, which mimic the brick-and-mortar nanostructure found in the nacreous layer of mollusk shells, is of great technological importance in developing light-weight reinforced materials, separation membranes, and gas-barrier coatings. Unfortunately, the widely utilized layer-by-layer self-assembly technology is tedious in creating thick multilayered coatings. Here we report a simple filtration technology that enables the scalable production of inorganic nanoplatelets-polymer nanocomposites with layered structures. Water suspended montmorillonite ({MTM}) nanoclay platelets are pre-mixed with polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}) aqueous solution to make stable colloidal suspensions. By using a simple vacuum filtration setup, ordered layered {MTM} nanoclay-{PVA} nanocomposites with controlled thickness can be easily prepared. The resulting selfstanding films exhibit higher tensile strength and toughness than those of natural inorganic-organic nanocomposites including nacre, bone, and dentin.},

	abstract = {As documented previously, articular cartilage exhibits a scale-dependent dynamic stiffness when probed by indentation-type atomic force microscopy ({IT}-{AFM}). In this study, a micrometer-size spherical tip revealed an unimodal stiffness distribution (which we refer to as microstiffness), whereas probing articular cartilage with a nanometer-size pyramidal tip resulted in a bimodal nanostiffness distribution. We concluded that indentation of the cartilage's soft proteoglycan ({PG}) gel gave rise to the~lower nanostiffness peak, whereas deformation of its collagen fibrils yielded the higher nanostiffness peak. To test our hypothesis, we produced a gel-microfiber composite consisting of a chondroitin sulfate-containing agarose gel and a fibrillar poly(ethylene glycol)-terephthalate/poly(butylene)-terephthalate block copolymer. In striking analogy to articular cartilage, the microstiffness distribution of the synthetic composite was unimodal, whereas its nanostiffness exhibited a bimodal distribution. Also, similar to the case with cartilage, addition of the negatively charged chondroitin sulfate rendered the gel-microfiber composite's water content responsive to salt. When the ionic strength of the surrounding buffer solution increased from 0.15 to 2 M {NaCl}, the cartilage's microstiffness increased by 21\%, whereas that of the synthetic biomaterial went up by 31\%. When the nanostiffness was measured after the ionic strength was raised by the same amount, the cartilage's lower peak increased by 28\%, whereas that of the synthetic biomaterial went up by 34\%. Of interest, the higher peak values remained unchanged for both materials. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the nanoscale lower peak is a measure of the soft {PG} gel, and the nanoscale higher peak measures collagen fibril stiffness. In contrast, the micrometer-scale measurements fail to resolve separate stiffness values for the {PG} and collagen fibril moieties. Therefore, we propose to use nanostiffness as a new biomarker to analyze structure-function relationships in normal, diseased, and engineered cartilage.},

These novel materials, based on a silica-gelatin hybrid system, have the potential to serve as a platform technology for human tissue regeneration. Covalent interactions between the inorganic and organic constituents of the hybrid are essential to enable the precise control of mechanical and dissolution properties. Furthermore, hybrid scaffold porosity is found to highly influence mechanical properties, to the extent where scaffolds of particular strength could be specified based on their porosity. The hybrids also demonstrate a non-cytotoxic effect when mesenchymal stem cells are cultured on the material. Cytoskeletal proteins of the cells are imaged using actin and vimentin staining.

Unlike previously reported degradable {PEG}-based hydrogels, these materials are homogeneous in structure, fully hydrophilic, and have highly specific cross-linking chemistry. We characterized hydrogel degradation and associated trends in mechanical properties, that is, storage modulus (G?), swelling ratio ({QM}), and mesh size (?). Degradation time and the monitored mechanical properties of the hydrogel correlated with cross-linker molecular weight, cross-linker functionality, and total polymer density; these properties changed predictably as degradation proceeded (G? decreased, whereas {QM} and ? increased) until the gels reached complete degradation. Balb/3T3 fibroblast adhesion and proliferation within the 3D hydrogel matrices were also verified. In sum, these unique properties indicate that the reported degradable {PEG} hydrogels are well poised for specific applications in protein and cell delivery to repair soft tissue.},

	abstract = {Collagen is the prime construction material in vertebrate biology, determining the mechanical behavior of connective tissues such as tendon, bone and skin. Despite extensive efforts in the investigation of the origin of collagen unique mechanical properties, a deep understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical structure of collagen-based tissues. In particular, although extensive studies of viscoelastic properties have been pursued at the macroscopic (fiber/tissue) level, fewer investigations have been performed at the smaller scales, including in particular collagen molecules and fibrils. These scales are, however, important for a complete understanding of the role of collagen as an important constituent in the extracellular matrix. Here, using an atomistic modeling approach, we perform in silico creep tests of a collagen-like peptide, monitoring the strain-time response for different values of applied external load. The results show that individual collagen molecules exhibit a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16 {GPa} (for strains up to 20\%), a viscosity of 3.84. {\textpm} 0.38 Pa{\textperiodcentered}s, and a relaxation time in the range of 0.24{\textendash}0.64 ns. The single molecule viscosity, for the first time reported here, is several orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity found for larger-scale single collagen fibrils, suggesting that the viscous behavior of collagen fibrils and fibers involves additional mechanisms, such as molecular sliding between collagen molecules within the fibril or the effect of relaxation of larger volumes of solvent. Based on our molecular modeling results we propose a simple structural model that describes collagen tissue as a hierarchical structure, providing a bottom-up description of elastic and viscous properties form the properties of the tissue basic building blocks.},

For this purpose, a recently developed generation method (radical like polymerization method) has been optimized to generate lamellar triblock copolymer samples with alternate glassy and rubbery stacks. Several systems, with various rate of loop (both ends of the chain are in the same glassy block), cilia (cut triblock, effectively a diblock chain) and tie molecules ({TMs}) (chain that bridges two subsequent glassy blocks through the intermediate rubbery block) were generated. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed, the tensile strain being applied in the normal direction of the lamellae. This situation can be understood as a simple way of mimicking the deformation of the equatorial stack in semicrystalline polymers, with the ?hard? phase being the glassy (rather than crystalline) one. The resulting constitutive laws reveal the key role of the tie molecules in the transmission of stress between glassy blocks. Decreasing the amount of tie molecules with respect to cilia chain leads to a decrease in the entanglement density, which affects the yield and the strain hardening behavior. It is also demonstrated that loop chains play the exact same role as tie molecules because they are strongly entangled.},

In this study, a double-network ({DN}) strategy was used to engineer strong hydrogels that can encapsulate cells. We improved upon previously studied double-network ({DN}) hydrogels by using a processing condition compatible with cell survival. The {DN} hydrogels were created by a two-step photocrosslinking using gellan gum methacrylate ({GGMA}) for the rigid and brittle first network, and gelatin methacrylamide ({GelMA}) for the soft and ductile second network. We controlled the degree of methacrylation of each polymer so that they obtain relevant mechanical properties as each network. The {DN} was formed by photocrosslinking the {GGMA}, diffusing {GelMA} into the first network, and photocrosslinking the {GelMA} to form the second network. The formation of the {DN} was examined by diffusion tests of the large {GelMA} molecules into the {GGMA} network, the resulting enhancement in the mechanical properties, and the difference in mechanical properties between {GGMA}/{GelMA} single networks ({SN}) and {DNs}. The resulting {DN} hydrogels exhibited the compressive failure stress of up to 6.9~{MPa}, which approaches the strength of cartilage. It was found that there is an optimal range of the crosslink density of the second network for high strength of {DN} hydrogels. {DN} hydrogels with a higher mass ratio of {GelMA} to {GGMA} exhibited higher strength, which shows promise in developing even stronger {DN} hydrogels in the future. Three dimensional (3D) encapsulation of {NIH}-3T3 fibroblasts and the following viability test showed the cell-compatibility of the {DN} formation process. Given the high strength and the ability to encapsulate cells, the {DN} hydrogels made from photocrosslinkable macromolecules could be useful for the regeneration of load-bearing tissues.},

In this paper, soft, single-component, supported hydrogel films were fabricated using pendant-thiol-modified poly(methacrylic acid) ({PMASH}). The influence of hydrogel architecture on deformation properties was studied by fabricating films on particle supports and producing free-standing capsules. The influence of the degree of thiol-based cross-linking on the mechanical properties of the soft hydrogel systems (core?shell and capsules) was studied using a colloidal-probe ({CP}) {AFM} technique. It was found that film mechanical properties, stability, and capsule swelling could be finely tuned by controlling the extent of poly(methacrylic acid) thiol modification. Furthermore, switching the {pH} from 7.4 to 4.0 led to film densification due to increased hydrogen bonding. Hydrogel capsule systems were found to have stiffness values ranging from 0.9 to 16.9 {mN} m-1 over a thiol modification range of 5 to 20 mol \%. These values are significantly greater than those for previously reported {PMASH} planar films of 0.7?5.7 {mN} m?1 over the same thiol modification range (Best et al., Soft Matter 2013, 9, 4580?4584). Films on particle substrates had comparable mechanical properties to planar films, demonstrating that while substrate geometry has a negligible effect, membrane and tension effects may play an important role in capsule force resistance. Further, when transitioning from solid-supported films to free-standing capsules, simple predictions of shell stiffness based on modulus changes found for supported films are not valid. Rather, additional effects like diameter increases (geometrical changes) as well as tension buildup need to be taken into account. These results are important for research related to the characterization of soft hydrogel materials and control over their mechanical properties.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A common approach for tissue regeneration is cell delivery, for example by direct transplantation of stem or progenitor cells. An alternative, by recruitment of endogenous cells, needs experimental evidence. We tested the hypothesis that the articular surface of the synovial joint can regenerate with a biological cue spatially embedded in an anatomically correct bioscaffold.
{METHODS}: In this proof of concept study, the surface morphology of a rabbit proximal humeral joint was captured with laser scanning and reconstructed by computer-aided design. We fabricated an anatomically correct bioscaffold using a composite of poly-epsilon-caprolactone and hydroxyapatite. The entire articular surface of unilateral proximal humeral condyles of skeletally mature rabbits was surgically excised and replaced with bioscaffolds spatially infused with transforming growth factor beta3 ({TGFbeta}3)-adsorbed or {TGFbeta}3-free collagen hydrogel. Locomotion and weightbearing were assessed 1-2, 3-4, and 5-8 weeks after surgery. At 4 months, regenerated cartilage samples were retrieved from in vivo and assessed for surface fissure, thickness, density, chondrocyte numbers, collagen type {II} and aggrecan, and mechanical properties.
{FINDINGS}: Ten rabbits received {TGFbeta}3-infused bioscaffolds, ten received {TGFbeta}3-free bioscaffolds, and three rabbits underwent humeral-head excision without bioscaffold replacement. All animals in the {TGFbeta}3-delivery group fully resumed weightbearing and locomotion 3-4 weeks after surgery, more consistently than those in the {TGFbeta}3-free group. Defect-only rabbits limped at all times. 4 months after surgery, {TGFbeta}3-infused bioscaffolds were fully covered with hyaline cartilage in the articular surface. {TGFbeta}3-free bioscaffolds had only isolated cartilage formation, and no cartilage formation occurred in defect-only rabbits. {TGFbeta}3 delivery yielded uniformly distributed chondrocytes in a matrix with collagen type {II} and aggrecan and had significantly greater thickness (p=0.044) and density (p{\textless}0.0001) than did cartilage formed without {TGFbeta}3. Compressive and shear properties of {TGFbeta}3-mediated articular cartilage did not differ from those of native articular cartilage, and were significantly greater than those of cartilage formed without {TGFbeta}3. Regenerated cartilage was avascular and integrated with regenerated subchondral bone that had well defined blood vessels. {TGFbeta}3 delivery recruited roughly 130\% more cells in the regenerated articular cartilage than did spontaneous cell migration without {TGFbeta}3.
{INTERPRETATION}: Our findings suggest that the entire articular surface of the synovial joint can regenerate without cell transplantation. Regeneration of complex tissues is probable by homing of endogenous cells, as exemplified by stratified avascular cartilage and vascularised bone. Whether cell homing acts as an adjunctive or alternative approach of cell delivery for regeneration of tissues with different organisational complexity warrants further investigation.

At a low content (\~{}4 wt\%) of surface grafted-{HAP} (g-{HAP}), the {PLLA}/g-{HAP} nano-composites exhibited higher bending strength and impact energy than the pristine {PLLA}, and at a higher g-{HAP} content (e.g., 20 wt\%), the modulus was remarkably increased. It implied that {PLLA} could be strengthened as well as toughened by g-{HAP} nano-particles. The results of biocompatibility test showed that the g-{HAP} existing in the {PLLA} composite facilitated both adhesion and proliferation of chondrocytes on the {PLLA}/g-{HAP} composite film.},

	abstract = {Arterial elasticity has gained importance in recent decades because it has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular diseases. Several in vivo and ex vivo techniques have been developed to characterize the elastic properties of vessels. In vivo techniques tend to ignore the anisotropy of the mechanical properties in the vessel wall, and therefore fail to characterize elasticity in different directions. Ex vivo techniques have been focused on studying the mechanical properties in different axes. In this paper, we present a technique that uses piezoelectric elements to measure the elasticity of soft tubes and excised arteries in two directions while maintaining the natural structure of these vessels. This technique uses sonometry data from piezoelectric elements to measure the strain in the longitudinal and circumferential directions while the tubes/arteries are being pressurized. We conducted experiments on urethane tubes to evaluate the technique and compared the experimental results with mechanical testing done on the materials used for making the tubes. We then performed sonometry experiments on excised pig carotid arteries assuming that they are transversely isotropic materials. To evaluate the sensitivity of this technique to changes in the material properties, we changed the temperature of the saline bath in which the arteries were immersed. The calculated Young's modulus from sonometry experiments for the urethane tubes and the mechanical testing values showed good agreement, deviating no more than 13.1\%. The elasticity values from the excised arteries and the behavior with the temperature changed agreed with previous work done in similar arteries. Therefore, we propose this technique for nondestructive testing of the biaxial properties of soft material tubes and excised arteries in their natural physiological shape.},

Dynamic indentation was performed to assess the effects of load, dynamic frequency and amplitude. Storage modulus values ranged from approximately 30 to 2300 {kPa} depending on agar concentration. Loss modulus remained consistently less than 30 {kPa} at all conditions, indicating a diminished damping response in agar.},

However, its use in load-bearing applications is limited due to low mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of a chitosan fiber reinforcement approach to enhancing the mechanical properties of chitosan scaffolds. Chitosan fibers were fabricated using a solution extrusion and neutralization method and incorporated into porous chitosan scaffolds. The effects of fiber/scaffold mass ratio, fiber mechanical properties and fiber length on scaffold mechanical properties were studied. The results showed that incorporating fibers improved scaffold strength and stiffness in proportion to the fiber/scaffold mass ratio. A fiber-reinforced, heart valve scaffold achieved leaflet tensile strength values of 220{\textpm}17~{kPa}, comparable to the radial values of human pulmonary valve leaflets. Additionally, the effects of 2~mm fibers were found to be up to threefold greater than 10 mm fibers at identical mass ratios. Heparin crosslinking of fibers produced a reduction in fiber strength, and thus failed to produce additional improvements to fiber-reinforced scaffold properties. Despite this reduction in fiber strength, heparin-modified fibers still improved the mechanical properties of reinforced scaffolds, but to a lesser extent than unmodified fibers. The results demonstrate that chitosan fiber reinforcement can be used to achieve porous chitosan scaffold strength approaching that of tissue, and that fiber length and mechanical properties are important parameters in defining the degree of mechanical improvement.},

A concurrent gel electrospray/polymer electrospinning method was employed to create {ECM} gel/{PEUU} fiber composites with attractive mechanical properties, including high flexibility and strength. Electron microscopy revealed a structure of interconnected fibrous layers embedded in {ECM} gel. Tensile mechanical properties could be tuned by altering the {PEUU}/{ECM} weight ratio. Scaffold tensile strengths for {PEUU}/{ECM} ratios of 67/33, 72/28 and~80/20 ranged from 80 to 187~{kPa} in the longitudinal axis (parallel to the collecting mandrel axis) and 41{\textendash}91~{kPa} in the circumferential axis with 645{\textendash}938\% breaking strains. The 72/28 biohybrid composite and a control scaffold generated from electrospun {PEUU} alone were implanted into Lewis rats, replacing a full-thickness abdominal wall defect. At 4~wk, no infection or herniation was found at the implant site. Histological staining showed extensive cellular infiltration into the biohybrid scaffold with the newly developed tissue well integrated with the native periphery, while minimal cellular ingress into the electrospun {PEUU} scaffold was observed. Mechanical testing of explanted constructs showed evidence of substantial remodeling, with composite scaffolds adopting properties more comparable to the native abdominal wall. The described elastic biohybrid material imparts features of {ECM} gel bioactivity with {PEUU} strength and handling to provide a promising composite biomaterial for soft tissue repair and replacement.},

Twelve ply laminates, all in the same direction, of woven bidirectional Kevlar 292, were prepared by hand lay-up, using an {SR} 1500 epoxy resin. The composite sheets were produced by a vacuum moulding process. The addition of nanoclays reduced static strength and increased the stiffness in both tension and bend loading.

	abstract = {Damage of paint films on pre-painted steel sheets ({PCMs}) in a deep drawing process is influenced by the mechanical properties of the paint films. We reported that paint films, which exhibit high elongation and low elastic strain energy ({ESE}) have good formability in a deep drawing process. However, examination of the paint films from a rheological viewpoint is needed for further clarification of the formability of {PCMs}. In this study, the viscoelastic properties of polyester/melamine paint films widely used for {PCMs} were studied concerning dynamic viscoelasticity, stress relaxation and creep. The effects of the viscoelastic properties of the films on the formability of {PCMs} were examined.

It is confirmed that paint films, which exhibit good formability in deep drawing, have higher glass transition temperature (Tg) than the temperature at which drawing was performed, also they have both low rubbery modulus and low creep viscosity. Furthermore, the rubbery modulus and the creep viscosity of such paint film decreases with the increase of strain. These results show that such paint films have low cross-linking density and that the cross-linking networks are easily destroyed by large deformation. We conclude that the paint films, which exhibit high plasticity in a large deformation process, have good formability in deep drawing.},

However, {PEG} hydrogels exhibit limited degradation under physiological conditions which hinders their ultimate applicability for tissue engineering therapies. Introduction of poly(L-lactic acid) ({PLLA}) chains into the {PEG} backbone results in copolymers that exhibit degradation via hydrolysis that can be controlled, in part, by the copolymer conditions. In this study, porous, {PEG}-{PLLA} hydrogels were generated by solvent casting/particulate leaching and photopolymerization. The influence of polymer conditions on hydrogel architecture, degradation and mechanical properties was investigated. Autofluorescence exhibited by the hydrogels allowed for three-dimensional, non-destructive monitoring of hydrogel structure under fully swelled conditions. The initial pore size depended on particulate size but not polymer concentration, while degradation time was dependent on polymer concentration. Compressive modulus was a function of polymer concentration and decreased as the hydrogels degraded. Interestingly, pore size did not vary during degradation contrary to what has been observed in other polymer systems. These results provide a technique for generating porous, degradable {PEG}-{PLLA} hydrogels and insight into how the degradation, structure, and mechanical properties depend on synthesis conditions.},

Also, the neurogenesis of {hMSCs} was controlled by the hydrogel stiffness in a 3D context without the use of any additional biochemical signal.

	abstract = {Hydrogels are used as scaffolds for tissue engineering, vehicles for drug delivery, actuators for optics and fluidics, and model extracellular matrices for biological studies. The scope of hydrogel applications, however, is often severely limited by their mechanical behaviour. Most hydrogels do not exhibit high stretchability; for example, an alginate hydrogel ruptures when stretched to about 1.2 times its original length. Some synthetic elastic hydrogels have achieved stretches in the range 10-20, but these values are markedly reduced in samples containing notches. Most hydrogels are brittle, with fracture energies of about 10 J m-2 (ref. 8), as compared with [sim]1,000 J m-2 for cartilage and [sim]10,000 J m-2 for natural rubbers. Intense efforts are devoted to synthesizing hydrogels with improved mechanical properties; certain synthetic gels have reached fracture energies of 100-1,000 J m-2 (refs 11, 14, 17). Here we report the synthesis of hydrogels from polymers forming ionically and covalently crosslinked networks. Although such gels contain [sim]90\% water, they can be stretched beyond 20 times their initial length, and have fracture energies of [sim]9,000 J m-2. Even for samples containing notches, a stretch of 17 is demonstrated. We attribute the gels/' toughness to the synergy of two mechanisms: crack bridging by the network of covalent crosslinks, and hysteresis by unzipping the network of ionic crosslinks. Furthermore, the network of covalent crosslinks preserves the memory of the initial state, so that much of the large deformation is removed on unloading. The unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage, which heals by re-zipping. These gels may serve as model systems to explore mechanisms of deformation and energy dissipation, and expand the scope of hydrogel applications.},

Deformation field parameters such as velocity and strain rate have been measured using the technique of particle image velocimetry. For this purpose, images of the indentation region were recorded in situ during the deformation process, and motion of 'asperities' specially introduced onto a side of the sample being indented was analysed. The velocity and strain rate fields in and around the indentation zone were obtained from an analysis of the asperity motions. The measurements have shown, among other things, the presence of a dead metal zone underneath the indenter, the formation and evolution of regions of intense strain rates or shear bands and a linear variation of the strain rate with indentation speed. Many of the characteristics of the deformation field, e.g. slip lines and dead metal zone, compare favourably with those inferred from classical solutions for this indentation problem. Extensions of the technique for the study of strain field around indentations and deformation in plane-strain indentation by wedges and cylinders are discussed.},

The matrix ligament is defined as the region of the matrix between two neighboring rubber particles. Specifically, the ligament thickness is the surface-to-surface interparticle distance. When the average ligament thickness is smaller than a critical value, a blend will be tough; when greater, it will be brittle. In other words, a sharp brittle{\textendash}tough transition occurs at the critical ligament thickness. This critical parameter is independent of rubber volume fraction and particle size, and is characteristic of the matrix for a given mode, temperature and rate of deformation. What is important is the matrix ligament, not rubber particles. The single matrix parameter explains the effects of phase morphology, rubber volume fraction, particle size, particle-size polydispersity, and particle flocculation on toughness.},

The sequence of events was carefully characterised using different microscopic techniques. It was found that under triaxial constraint interfacial cavitation followed by multiple crazing and subsequently massive shear yielding of the matrix contributed to an enormous toughening effect in core-shell microstructures observed in 0.92\%-maleated blend (0.74\% in Part I paper [Wong {SC}, Mai Y-W. Polymer, 1999;40:1553], should be 0.92\% as corrected in this paper). The core-shell structure was formed when the spherical domains of {PP} were surrounded by {SEBS} rubber in a nylon-rich matrix.. In this composition, miscibility between the dispersed {SEBS}-g-{MA} and the nylon phase was maximised as revealed by thermal-mechanical analysis. The {SEBS} was most effective in toughening the nylon/{PP} blends when it cavitated to introduce ligament bridges between debonded {PP} particles at the crack tip. Interfacial cavitation and multiple crazing served to relieve the hydrostatic tension ahead of crack growth and subsequently enhanced the shear-yielding component of stresses in the matrix material. Other blend compositions that did not show controlled cavitation resulted in little plastic flow surrounding the crack tip and reduced fracture toughness. These results reinforced the notion that cavitation of {SEBS} at the nylon{\textendash}{PP} interface was an essential mechanism to promote toughening in materials subjected to high crack tip triaxiality.},

The morphology and static mechanical and impact properties of the blends were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, uniaxial tension, and instrumented falling-weight impact measurements. Tensile tests showed that the yield strength of the {PS}/{HDPE}/{SEBS} blends decreases considerably with increasing {HDPE} content. However, the elongation at break of the blends tended to increase significantly with increasing {HDPE} content. The excellent tensile ductility of the {HDPE}-rich blends resulted from shield yielding of the matrix. Charpy impact measurements indicated that the impact strength of the blends increases slowly with {HDPE} content up to 50 wt \%; thereafter, it increases sharply with increasing {HDPE} content. The impact energy of the {HDPE}-rich blends exceeded that of pure {HDPE}, implying that the {HDPE} polymer can be further toughened by the incorporation of brittle {PS} minor phase in the presence of {SEBS} compatibilizer.

	abstract = {The state of dispersion of poly(ethylene-co-propylene) ({PEP}) rubber and high-density polyethylene ({HDPE}) in polypropylene ({PP}) blends was investigated using scanning electron microscopy to examine solvent-etched microtomed surfaces cut at low temperatures. The validity of the method was established by comparing the areal fraction of dispersed particles in micrographs with the volume fraction of {PEP} and {HDPE} in {PP}-rich blends. When small amounts of {PEP} and {HDPE} were added to {PP}, they combined to form composite {PEP}{\textendash}{HDPE} particles with characteristic internal structures in a {PP} matrix. Changes in impact strength and flexural modulus with changes in mixing conditions and blend composition were determined and interpreted in terms of the size, composition, and internal structure of the dispersed particles. Particle growth in the melt limited the impact strength level achieved in molded articles. A simple model proposed for screening rubbers for toughening of brittle plastics successfully predicts that {PEP} rubber should be an excellent impact modifier for {PP}.},

The aim of the work was to study the influences of {EOR} characteristics and its concentration on the tensile and impact properties of the blends. The matrix ligament thickness between rubber particles was measured and compared to those predicted using the theoretical models. The relationships between blend morphology and impact property were reported. It was found that the content of comonomer and molecular weight of the {EOR} as well as its concentration in the blends were the major factors controlling the tensile and impact properties of the blends. These factors became ineffective to impact property when the ligament thickness of the matrix was larger than the critical value (T \~{}0.3{\textendash}0.4 $\mu$m). To achieve blends of high impact strength, the ligament thickness between rubber particles should be smaller than the critical value, and for a certain ligament thickness, {EOR} with high octene content and high molecular weight was preferred. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The mechanochemistry of a novel economical solid-state shear extrusion ({SSSE}) pulverization is investigated. {SSSE} compatibilizes incompatible blends in situ; the process has great potential in recycling of post-consumer plastic waste ({PCPW}). It is proposed that {SSSE} causes this self-compatibilization of blends by rupturing polymer chains and allowing them to recombine with their neighboring chains. When this recombination involves dissimilar chains at an interface between powder particles, block copolymers are formed, and if the chain transfer reactions are possible, graft copolymers are formed. These copolymers at the interfaces in the phase-separated, incompatible blend lower the interfacial tension and increase the adhesion at the interfaces, thus compatibilizing the blend. Our nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) and rheology studies reveal the formation of long chain branches ({LCBs}) in an linear low-density polyethylene ({LLDPE}), which is equivalent to the formation of graft copolymers in blends. With {NMR}, an increase from \~{} 0.2 to \~{} 2.0 of the number of {LCBs} per 1000 carbon atoms is observed due to pulverization of the {LLDPE}. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The most efficient of the {EPDM} impact modifiers had melt viscosities similar to that of the starting {PP} under the conditions of mixing. The course of maximum load at rupture (Fmax) and notched impact strength as functions of temperature showed some analogies with one another as well as with the dynamic mechanical storage (E') and with the mechanical loss factor (tan $\delta$). Thus, linear regression analysis was applied to the following relations: Fmax vs. (E'; tan $\delta$; impact strength), F2max vs. (tan $\delta$, impact strength) and impact strength vs. tan $\delta$. The optimum correlation coefficients were obtained for Fmax vs. E' and impact strength vs. tan $\delta$. The supposed linearity of the former relation suggested that notched small Charpy specimens behaved as linear elastic bodies at high-rate three-point bending while the latter function referred to the significant role of relaxation of the {EPDM} impact modifier in the dissipation of impact energy during brittle or semi-brittle fracture of the two-phase {PP}/{EPDM} blends. The above relations are rendered probable by the fact that frequency of impact load is 102 to 103 Hz while that of the dynamic mechanical measurements is about 101 Hz.},

This first article describes the methods and processing conditions used for molding, together with mechanical test results. Both conventional and shear-controlled orientation injection molding ({SCORIM}) have been employed for the production of moldings. {SCORIM} is based on the application of specific macroscopic shears to a solidifying melt, which in turn, facilitates enhanced molecular alignment. {SCORIM} results in more pronounced molecular orientation than conventional injection molding, which is consistent with the substantial increase in Young's modulus of moldings produced by {SCORIM}. By controlling the processing parameters it is possible to control and enhance the stiffness without loss of tensile strength. An increase of up to four times in impact strength has been achieved with {SCORIM} as well as a substantial increase in Young's modulus. The conventional injection moldings containing pronounced molecular orientation exhibited impact resistance well below that for the {SCORIM} moldings. The mechanical tests carried out at 80{\textdegree}C showed that the high-temperature mechanical properties of all the materials, converted into moldings using {SCORIM}, exhibited substantial enhancement when compared with moldings of the same material converted by conventional injection molding. {\textcopyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The toughness of the blends was determined from the tensile fracture energy of the side-edge notched samples. The concept of interparticle distance ({ID}) was introduced into this study to probe the size effect on the {BDT} of {PP}/{EPDM} blends, whereas the effect of time corresponded to that of strain rate. The {BDT} induced by size, temperature, and time was observed in the fracture energy versus {ID}, temperature, and strain rate. The critical {BDT} temperatures for various {EPDM} contents at different initial strain rates were obtained from these transitions. The critical interparticle distance ({IDc}) increased nonlinearly with increasing temperature, and when the initial strain rate was lower, the {IDc} was larger. Moreover, the variation of the reciprocal of the initial strain rate with the reciprocal of temperature followed different straight lines for various {EPDM} contents. These straight lines were with the same slope. Furthermore, a diagram at critical {BDT} points in three dimensions ({ID}, T, and initial strain rate) was given for the {PP}/{EPDM} blends. The brittle and ductile zones are clearly shown in this diagram. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci Part B: Polym Phys 42: 1433{\textendash}1440, 2004},

Analysis of data of dynamic mechanical properties and impact properties at various compositions of the blends revealed a direct correlation between impact properties and dynamic mechanical loss tangent.

Results of {SEM} and {DMA} show that ethylene{\textendash}propylene rubber ({EPR}) and part of the ethylene{\textendash}propylene segmented copolymer disperse as toughening particles in the {ICPP}. The size and size distribution of these particles are determined by chain structure of the fractions of {ICPP}. From fraction A to fraction D, the morphology changes from noncrystalline to semicrystalline gradually, as shown by {DSC}. {DSC} results also indicate that thermal behavior of the {ICPP} agrees greatly with its chain structure. {PLM} demonstrates that it is difficult for the {ICPP} to grow perfect spherulites, that is, partially, because the matrix of {ICPP}, fraction D, has defects in its macromolecular chain. Another cause is that there is a good compatible structure in the {ICPP} and so the noncrystalline component (including all fractions) hinders the growth of the spherulite. {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The control scheme is simulated based on an empirical model derived from actual valve measurement data. The results show that the proposed {MPID} controller provides better step response, command following, and greater bandwidth than conventional methods. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the robust control is achieved in the presence of significant dynamic variations in the valve. In particular, it is shown that satisfactory performance can be maintained when the valve hysteresis characteristics are varied by as much as 30\%},

Three {iPP}/{EPR} grades with modifier contents of 15, 21 and 30 vol\% were investigated. As the deformation rate increased, relatively uniform necking of the whole ligament and extensive plastic deformation were progressively replaced by more localized plastic deformation in the blends, and by fully brittle fracture in the unmodified {iPP}. The non-essential work of fracture and the total fracture energy were highly sensitive to these changes in deformation mechanism. However, the essential work of fracture, although dependent on the test speed, was less correlated with the extent of global plasticity.},

It was found that the mode and state of dispersion of the {EPR} copolymers, as well as the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the blends, depended upon the composition of the copolymer used in the blends for given crystallization conditions. The observed behaviour is very similar to that reported for high-density polyethylene/ethylene-propylene copolymer blends in the first paper of this series.

	abstract = {Isotactic polypropylene ({iPP}) based blends containing as second component ethylene-propylene copolymers ({EPR}) having, for constant propylene (C3) content (wt/wt), different average molecular masses (M?w and/or M?n) and, for constant average molecular mass, different molecular mass distributions ({MMD}) were investigated. The study was undertaken to establish the influence of the melt phase viscosity ratio $\mu$ in determining the average particle size of the {EPR} phase in the vicinity of the minimum expected according to the Taylor-Tomotika theory for the average particle size versus log $\mu$ function, when $\mu$ is about equal to unity (in previous studies we have in fact reached $\mu$ values far above 1). Moreoever, we also report the effects of molecular mass and molecular mass distribution of the {EPR} phase on the melt rheological behaviour of {iPP}/{EPR} blends, on the mode and state of dispersion of the {EPR} phase in the melt, as well as, in the solid state after {iPP} crystallization in injection moulded samples, on the crystalline lamellar thickness and the thickness of the amorphous interlayer of {iPP} phase, and finally on the impact properties of blend materials. It should be pointed out that the apparent viscosity of all the {iPP}/{EPR} blends investigated is expected to obey the logarithm additivity rule that applies at constant temperature and shear rate. The application of the Cross-Bueche equation revealed that the zero-shear viscosity $\eta$o of these {iPP}/{EPR} blends deviates positively from the logarithm additivity rule. Assuming that the crystallization of the {iPP} phase freezes the morphology of the {EPR} phase, a strict correlation is confirmed to exist between the values of {EPR} particle size and {EPR} particle size range, as measured by scanning electron microscopy on samples in the solid state, and $\mu$ value. The number average particle diameter (D?n) and the particle size range of the {EPR} phase (D) are found to increase with increasing $\mu$ value as expected according to the Taylor-Tomotika theory. Finally, when the {iPP} phase crystallizes from its blends with {EPR} under non-isothermal conditions, the phase structure developed in the blends is characterized by lamellar thickness and interlamellar amorphous layer thickness, respectively, lower and higher than that shown by plain {iPP}.},

The initial morphology was observed by optical transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore the influence of the rubber composition on the neck formation was analysed and the tensile mechanical properties of the fibres evaluated as well. Up to 10\% of {EPR} in the blend, the morphology of {iPP} was only slightly changed. At higher {EPR} content, a decrease in spherulite size was observed. The curves of modulus Eversus drawing temperature Td exhibited a change in the drawing mechanism at a temperature Ti. This transition temperature increased on enhancing the crystallization temperature Tc and is almost independent of the {EPR} content. The change in the flowing mechanism was also visible by direct inspection of the specimen fibres which were opaque for Td \&lt; Ti and transparent for Td \&gt;Ti. These features were indicative of a dependence of the drawing mechanisms on the initial morphology and on the testing temperature. The fibre modulus depended strongly on the drawing temperature Td but not on the crystallization temperature Tc. This suggested that an almost complete cancellation of the initial morphology occurred after fibre formation. The effect of the rubber addition was a decrease of the Young's modulus of the fibres in all the blends. A tentative interpretation of the above illustrated features has been provided.},

The results show that the addition of {PEc} decreases significantly crystallization temperature (Tc) of {iPP}, but slightly affects melting temperature (Tm). With increasing the ethylene-unit content of the propylene{\textendash}ethylene copolymers, the decrease in crystallization temperature of {iPP} is smaller. The {PLM} results show that the spherulite growth rate decreases with increasing crystallization temperature for {iPP} and {iPP}/{PEc} blends. The higher the ethylene-unit content of the copolymers is, the lower the spherulite growth rate (G) of {iPP}/{PEc} blends is. The influence of the {PEc} on nucleation rate constant (Kg) and fold surface energy ($\sigma$e) of {iPP} was examined by nucleation theory of Hoffman and Lauritzen. The results show that both Kg and $\sigma$e of {iPP}/{PE}20(80/20) and {iPP}/{PE}23(80/20) blends are higher than those of {iPP}, demonstrating that the overall crystallization rate of {iPP}/{PEc} blends decreased as compared to that of {iPP}, resulting from the decrease of the nucleation rate and the spherulite growth rate of {iPP}. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Polypropylene ({PP}) and calcium carbonate nanocomposites were prepared by melt mixing in a Haake mixer. The average primary particle size of the {CaCO}3 nanoparticles was measured to be about 44 nm. The dispersion of the {CaCO}3 nanoparticles in {PP} was good for filler content below 9.2 vol\%. Differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}) results indicated that the {CaCO}3 nanoparticles are a very effective nucleating agent for {PP}. Tensile tests showed that the modulus of the nanocomposites increased by approximately 85\%, while the ultimate stress and strain, as well as yield stress and strain were not much affected by the presence of {CaCO}3 nanoparticles. The results of the tensile test can be explained by the presence of the two-counter balancing forces{\textemdash}the reinforcing effect of the {CaCO}3 nanoparticles and the decrease in spherulite size of the {PP}. Izod impact tests suggested that the incorporation of {CaCO}3 nanoparticles in {PP} has significantly increased its impact strength by approximately 300\%. J-integral tests showed a dramatic 500\% increase in the notched fracture toughness. Micrographs of scanning electron microscopy revealed the absence of spherulitic structure for the {PP} matrix. In addition, {DSC} results indicated the presence of a small amount of $\beta$ phase {PP} after the addition of the calcium carbonate nanoparticles. We believe that the large number of {CaCO}3 nanoparticles can act as stress concentration sites, which can promote cavitation at the particle{\textendash}polymer boundaries during loading. The cavitation can release the plastic constraints and trigger mass plastic deformation of the matrix, leading to much improved fracture toughness.},

Maleic anhydride molecules, inserted onto the rubber backbone, provided the functionalized sites with which the terminal {PBT} hydroxide groups could react. A graft copolymer made from an {EPR} backbone and by {PBT} branches acted as an interfacial agent between the matrix and the rubbery dispersed phase. The intensity of mixing, represented by the roller speed of the mixing equiment, was varied from 4 to 64 rpm. The morphological features as well as the mechanical impact performance improved with increasing the roller speed up to a value of 48 rpm. Beyond such a value the situation was reversed due to the mechanical degradation of the molten {PBT}. This induced a diminished internal interconnection of the matrix and hence a worse impact resistance. Dynamic mechanical analysis proved to be a very sensitive tool to detect the presence of interzones existing between the {PBT} matrix and the {EPR} rubbery particles. The extension of such zones represents the adhesion between the two components and was also detected by Charpy impact tests.},

The presence of either {PEO} or {gPEO} did not influence either the nature of the {PBT} phase or the crystallisation of {PBT}. Low injection speeds (7 cm3/s) and {gPEO} provided the best mechanical response. Increasing levels of maleic anhydride in {gPEO} led to a continuous overall decrease in the particle size, that was the most important when the particle size of the ungrafted {PEO} and that of the {PEO} at the minimum grafting level were compared. The decrease stopped at a grafting level between 1.14 and 1.80 due to the viscosity increase with the grafting level. Super-tough {PBT} based blends with impact strength more than twenty-fold that of {PBT} were obtained at {PEO} contents equal to or higher than 15\%, and at decreasing {PEO} contents when the grafting level increased. The inter-particle distance ($\tau$) is the parameter that controls toughness in these {PBT}/{PEO} blends. When the critical $\tau$ ($\tau$c) measured in this work for {PBT} was compared with those obtained in other toughened blends at constant test conditions and rubber properties, $\tau$c decreased as the modulus of elasticity of the matrix increased. When $\tau$c of this work was compared with those obtained in other {PBT}/rubber blends, it depended on the modulus of elasticity of the dispersed phase, and it increased rather linearly as the {PBT} modulus to rubber modulus ratio increased.},

For this study, a elastic material of poly (L-lactic acid-co-$\epsilon$-caprolactone) (P({LLA}-{CL})), collagen and chitosan blended scaffold at different ratios were fabricated by electrospinning. Upon fabrication, the scaffolds were evaluated to determine the tensile strength, burst pressure, and dynamic compliance. In addition, the contact angle and endothelial cell proliferation on the scaffolds were evaluated to demonstrate the structures potential to serve as a vascular prosthetic capable of in situ regeneration. The collagen/chitosan/P({LLA}-{CL}) scaffold with the ratio of 20:5:75 reached the highest tensile strength with the value of 16.9 {MPa}, and it was elastic with strain at break values of \~{}112\%, elastic modulus of 10.3 {MPa}. The burst pressure strength of the scaffold was greater than 3365 {mmHg} and compliance value was 0.7\%/100 {mmHg}. Endothelial cells proliferation was significantly increased on the blended scaffolds versus the P({LLA}-{CL}). Meanwhile, the endothelial cells were more adherent based on the increase in the degree of cell spreading on the surface of collagen/chitosan/P({LLA}-{CL}) scaffolds. Such blended scaffold especially with the ratio of 20:5:75 thus has the potential for vascular graft applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part A, 2012.},

	abstract = {Objectives. This observational study was set up to prospectively follow all bovine heterograft ({ProCol}{\textregistered}) fistulas implanted for hemodialysis access between 1998 and 2002.

Methods. {ProCol}{\textregistered} was implanted if autogenous vein was not available or if patients presented with a history of failed, infected or otherwise complicated {ePTFE} grafts and/or on immunosuppressive therapy. Fistula patency was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes were clinical events and the rate of access revisions.

Results. Sixty-two {ProCol}{\textregistered} grafts were implanted in 56 patients. The mean primary ({PP}) and secondary patency ({SP}) was 334 ({SEM} 57) and 528 ({SEM} 59) days, respectively. Coronary heart disease was associated with a significantly better {SP} ({OR} 0.2, 95\% {CI} 0.1{\textendash}0.9) whilst diabetes mellitus was associated with a significantly worse {SP} ({OR} 0.2, 95\% {CI} 0.1{\textendash}0.9). Reinterventions were performed at a mean rate of 1.23 ({SEM} 0.17) per fistula. The relative risk of access revision was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus ({OR} 9.2, 95\% {CI} 2.3{\textendash}37.2).

Conclusions. {ProCol}{\textregistered} grafts, used for {AV}-fistulas, demonstrate acceptable patency rates in high-risk haemodialysis patients. Diabetes mellitus jeopardizes the patency of these fistulas and is associated with a high revision rate.},

A major factor in this is compliance mismatch between the graft and the diseased vessel, which may cause intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis. {PTFE} and Dacron are rigid grafts with poor compliance. By improving the compliance of the prosthetic graft it is hoped that patency will improve. Recent advances in polyurethane chemistry have developed materials that do not degrade and which allow compliance matching of the graft to the patient's vasculature. It is now possible to manufacture biologically and haemodynamically compatible grafts with small diameter from these polyurethane graft materials. This review will focus on the lack of compliance in current vascular bypass grafts and the promise of the new polyurethane polymers in a new generation of small-bore bypass grafts.},

In this study, we present polydopamine-mediated immobilization of growth factors on the surface of polymeric materials as a versatile tool to modify surface characteristics of vascular grafts potentially for accelerated endothelialization. Polydopamine was deposited on the surface of biocompatible poly(l-lactide-co-$\varepsilon$-caprolactone) ({PLCL}) elastomer, on which vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF}) was subsequently immobilized by simple dipping. Surface characteristics and composition were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Immobilization of {VEGF} on the polydopamine-deposited {PLCL} films was effective (19.8 {\textpm} 0.4 and 197.4 {\textpm} 19.7 ng/cm2 for {DPv}20 and {DPv}200 films, respectively), and biotin-mediated labeling of immobilized {VEGF} revealed that the fluorescence intensity increased as a function of the concentration of {VEGF} solution. The effect of {VEGF} on adhesion of {HUVECs} was marginal, which may have been masked by polydopamine layer that also enhanced cell adhesion. However, {VEGF}-immobilized substrate significantly enhanced proliferation of {HUVECs} for over 7 days of in vitro culture and also improved their migration. In addition, immobilized {VEGF} supported robust cell to cell interactions with strong expression of {CD} 31 marker. The same process was effective for immobilization of basic fibroblast growth factor, demonstrating the robustness of polydopamine layer for secondary ligation of growth factors as a simple and novel surface modification strategy for vascular graft materials.},

In this study, the structural and mechanical properties and the vascular cell compatibility of electrospun recombinant human tropoelastin ({rTE}) were evaluated as a potential vascular graft support matrix. Disuccinimidyl suberate ({DSS}) was used to cross-link electrospun {rTE} fibers to produce a polymeric recombinant tropoelastin ({prTE}) matrix that is stable in aqueous environments. Tubular 1 cm diameter {prTE} samples were constructed for uniaxial tensile testing and 4 mm small-diameter {prTE} tubular scaffolds were produced for burst pressure and cell compatibility evaluations from 15 wt.\% {rTE} solutions. Uniaxial tensile tests demonstrated an average ultimate tensile strength ({UTS}) of 0.36 {\textpm} 0.05 {MPa} and elastic moduli of 0.15 {\textpm} 0.04 and 0.91 {\textpm} 0.16 {MPa}, which were comparable to extracted native elastin. Burst pressures of 485 {\textpm} 25 mm Hg were obtained from 4 mm internal diameter scaffolds with 453 {\textpm} 74 $\mu$m average wall thickness. {prTE} supported endothelial cell growth with typical endothelial cell cobblestone morphology after 48 h in culture.

The vascular biomaterial must support cell growth, be non-thrombogenic, minimize intimal hyperplasia, match the structural properties of native vessels, and allow for regeneration of arterial tissue. Electrospun recombinant human tropoelastin ({rTE}) as a medial component of a vascular graft scaffold was investigated in this study by evaluating its structural properties, as well as its ability to support primary smooth muscle cell adhesion and growth. {rTE} solutions of 9, 15, and 20 wt\% were electrospun into sheets with average fiber diameters of 167 {\textpm} 32, 522 {\textpm} 67, and 735 {\textpm} 270 nm, and average pore sizes of 0.4 {\textpm} 0.1, 5.8 {\textpm} 4.3, and 4.9 {\textpm} 2.4 {\textmu}m, respectively. Electrospun {rTE} fibers were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate to produce an insoluble fibrous polymeric recombinant tropoelastin ({prTE}) biomaterial. Smooth muscle cells attached via integrin binding to the {rTE} coatings and proliferated on {prTE} biomaterials at a comparable rate to growth on {prTE} coated glass, glass alone, and tissue culture plastic. Electrospun tropoelastin demonstrated the cell compatibility and design flexibility required of a graft biomaterial for vascular applications.},

Both morphology and diameter of the composite grafts were studied by Scanning Electron Microscope ({SEM}). The results of mechanical tests showed that the composite scaffolds provided the whole grafts with better strength and flexibility compared with blended grafts, mainly due to the fact that the middle layer was P({LLA}-{CL}). Cell viability studies with endothelial cells suggested a prompt adhesion and proliferation duo to the fact that the outer layer was collagen and chitosan. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that a monolayer of endothelial cells could be formed after 7 days of culture.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
Objective To investigate the influence of increasing age on
the incidence and remaining lifetime risk of
cardiovascular disease and cancer in a cohort of older
men.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting United States.
Participants 22 048 male doctors aged 40-84 who were
free of major disease in 1982.
Main outcome measures Incidence and remaining lifetime
risk of major cardiovascular disease (myocardial
infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease)
and cancer.
Results 3252 major cardiovascular events and 5400
incident cancers were confirmed over 23 years of followup.
The incidence of major cardiovascular disease
continued to increase to age 100. Beginning at age 80,
however, major cardiovascular disease was more likely to
be diagnosed at death. The incidence of cancer peaked in
those aged 80-89 and then declined. Cancers detected by
screening accounted for most of the decline, whereas
most cancers for which there was no screening continued
to increase to age 100. Unadjusted cumulative incidence
overestimated the risk of cardiovascular disease by 16\%
and cancer by 8.5\%. The remaining lifetime risk of cancer
at age 40 was 45.1\% (95\% confidence interval 43.8\% to
46.3\%) and at age 90 was 9.6\% (7.2\% to 11.9\%). The
remaining lifetime risk of major cardiovascular disease at
age 40 was 34.8\% (33.1\% to 36.5\%) and at age 90 was
16.7\% (12.9\% to 20.6\%).
Conclusions In this prospective cohort of men, the
incidence of new cardiovascular disease continued to
increase after age 80 but was most often diagnosed at
death. The decrease in incidence of cancer late in life
seemed largely due to a decline in cancers usually
detected by screening. These findings suggest that people
aged 80 and older have a substantial amount of
undiagnosed disease. The remaining lifetime risk of both
diseases approached a plateau in the 10th decade. This
may be due to decreased detection of disease and
reporting of symptoms and increased resistance to
disease in those who survive to old age. Accurate
estimates of disease risk in an aging population require
adjustment for competing risks of mortality.},

Coating of graft material with homing factors for circulating stem cells has the potential to improve endogenous endothelialization of these grafts and to reduce graft failure. Synthetic knitted polyester grafts (6 mm diameter) were coated with {FN} and {SDF}-1$\alpha$ before surgical interposition in the carotid artery of sheep. Similar uncoated vascular grafts were implanted in the contralateral side as internal controls. To study the early attraction of stem cells, grafts were implanted in a first series of nine sheep and explanted after 1 or 3 days. In coated grafts, four times higher fractions of {CD}34+ and three to four times higher fractions of {CD}117+ cells adhering to the vessel walls were found than in control grafts (P \&lt; 0.05). When such coated and non-coated grafts were implanted in 12 other sheep and explanted after 3 months, all coated grafts were patent, while one control graft was occluded. {EcNOS} staining revealed that {FN}-{SDF}-1$\alpha$ coating significantly increased coverage with endothelial cells from 27 {\textpm} 4\% of the graft to 48 {\textpm} 4\% compared with the controls (P = 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction of intimal hyperplasia (average thickness 1.03 {\textpm} 0.09 mm in controls vs. 0.69 {\textpm} 0.04 mm in coated grafts; P = 0.009) and significantly less adhesion of thrombotic material in the middle part of the graft (P = 0.029). {FN}-{SDF}-1$\alpha$ coating of synthetic small-caliber vascular grafts stimulated the attraction of stem cells and was associated with improved endothelialization and reduced intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis.},

Observations of the composite surface with atomic force microscopy and of the internal pore structure with scanning electron microscopy showed that increasing immersion times resulted into smoother surface composites and allowed further infiltration of fibrin into the microporous structure of {BC}. Tensile strength and cyclic creep tests demonstrated that the composition had significant impact on the ultimate tensile stress and cyclic creep strain level of {BC}/fibrin composites.

Glutaraldehyde-treated (bacterial cellulose) {BC}/fibrin composites exhibited tensile strength and modulus comparable to a reference small-diameter blood vessel; namely a bovine coronary artery. However, the breaking strain of the glutaraldehyde-treated composites was still well below that of the native blood vessel. Yet a long strain hardening plateau was induced by glutaraldehyde treatment which resembled the stress{\textendash}strain response of the native blood vessel. Tensile cyclic creep test indicated that the time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of glutaraldehyde-treated {BC}/fibrin composites was comparable to that of the native blood vessel. Covalent bonding between {BC} and fibrin occurred via glutaraldehyde, affording mechanical properties comparable to that of the native small blood vessel.},

materials for a variety of applications such as biomedical engineering, sanitary
products, agriculture, bioseparation, enhanced oil recovery, etc. They have
been successfully used as superabsorbent materials and in drug delivery, cell

biocompatibility. Considering the fact that water retention in the hydrogels provides a
suitable drug diffusion pathway; many hydrogel-based networks have been designed
and fabricated as intelligent carriers of drugs. The rate and degree of hydrogel swelling
are the most important parameters which control the release patterns of solvents and
drugs from these polymeric networks. Therefore, the precise account of hydrogel
behaviour as well as mathematical description of equilibrium swelling, dimensional
changes due to solvent uptake, desorption and drug release profiles were the main
objectives in many investigations. The objective of this manuscript is to give a brief
review on existing mathematical models and theories in the field of hydrogel swelling

Two overlapping graphene sheets containing oxygenated functional groups represented the oxidized {VGCNF} surfaces. Two liquid {VE} bisphenol-A dimethacrylates (designated {VE}1 and {VE}2, respectively) and styrene constituted the resin. Temporally and spatially averaged relative monomer concentrations, calculated in a direction away from the oxidized graphene surfaces, showed increased styrene and {VE}1 concentrations. Monomer molar ratios found within a 10 {\r A} thick region adjacent to the oxidized graphene sheets were substantially different from those in the bulk resin. Curing should result in the formation of a very thin interphase region of different composition. The crosslink structure of such an interphase will be distinct from that of an unoxidized {VGCNF} surface. The enhanced {VE}1 concentration near this oxidized surface should give a higher crosslink density, leading to a stiffer interphase than that adjacent to unoxidized {VGCNF} surfaces. {VGCNF}{\textendash}matrix adhesion may also be modified by the different interphase monomer molar ratios. These studies may facilitate multiscale material design by providing insight into carbon nanofiber{\textendash}matrix interactions leading to improved macroscale composite properties.},

Irrespective of the particle size, the drying film contained, simultaneously, domains consisting of a fluid dispersion, a fully dried packing of deformed spheres, and a close packed array saturated with water. Interestingly, films cast from dispersions containing 95-nm sized particles developed tensile stresses and ultimately became transparent even in the absence of water, indicating that van der Waals forces can deform the particles. Employing the stress?strain relation for a drying latex film along with the well-known Griffith's energy balance concept, we calculate the critical stress at cracking and the accompanying crack spacing, in general agreement with the observed values.},

The Tgs of the block copolymer films showed excellent agreement with those of multilayer films constructed from homopolymer layers with an equivalent morphology, indicating that chain connectivity across the immiscible interface has little impact on cooperative segmental dynamics within the individual layers/domains. The difference in the Tg?nanoconfinement behavior exhibited by the {PS} free-surface layer of P(S-b-{MMA}) and P(S-b-2VP) block copolymer films, and equivalently exhibited by the {PS} free-surface layer of {PS}/{PMMA} and {PS}/P2VP bilayer films, is due to the much stronger attractive interaction at the P2VP?silica substrate interface. Once the P2VP?silica substrate interaction is removed, the P2VP underlayer is no longer able to suppress the enhanced mobility of a {PS} free-surface layer when the underlayer thickness is made sufficiently thin (},

	abstract = {By selective placement of fluorescent dyes, we have measured the glass transition temperature (Tg) of individual layers within supported bilayer films of different polymers to determine the extent to which strong free-surface effects and substrate interactions are mediated by a narrow interface between immiscible polymers. We have discovered that the impact a free surface has on Tg within an ultrathin {PS} layer is extremely sensitive to the polymer species used in the underlayer. The large Tg reduction of ?32 K relative to bulk Tg observed for a 14 nm thick surface layer of polystyrene ({PS}) supported on bulk {PS} is virtually eliminated when a 14 nm thick surface layer of {PS} is placed on an underlayer of poly(methyl methacrylate) or poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), even of bulk thickness. Thus, the cooperative segmental mobility associated with the Tg of the {PS} free-surface layer is greatly hindered by the narrow, several-nanometer-wide interfacial region formed with the dissimilar polymer underlayer. This indicates that the dynamics of nanoscale layers can be strongly modified by adjacent layers or domains of unlike polymers via propagation of effects across an interfacial layer of cooperatively rearranging regions containing segments of the two immiscible polymers, which has important implications for multilayer films and nanostructured blends. Conversely, the Tg of an ultrathin P2VP film is unaffected by the presence of a {PS} capping layer, indicating that strong attractive interactions of P2VP with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the silica substrate dominate over a much weaker free-surface effect in P2VP.},

Nanocomposites are made by spin coating films from sonicated solutions of polymer, nanofiller, and dye. The Tgs and physical aging rates are measured by fluorescence of trace levels of dye in the films. At 0.1{\textendash}10 vol \% nanofiller, Tg values can be enhanced or depressed relative to neat, bulk Tg (Tg,bulk) or invariant with nanofiller content. For alumina nanocomposites, Tg increases relative to Tg,bulk by as much as 16 K in P2VP, decreases by as much as 5 K in {PMMA}, and is invariant in {PS}. By analogy with thin polymer films, these results are explained by wetted P2VP{\textendash}nanofiller interfaces with attractive interactions, nonwetted {PMMA}{\textendash}nanofiller interfaces (free space at the interface), and wetted {PS}{\textendash}nanofiller interfaces lacking attractive interactions, respectively. The presence of wetted or nonwetted interfaces is controlled by choice of solvent. For example, 0.1{\textendash}0.6 vol \% silica/{PMMA} nanocomposites exhibit Tg enhancements as large as 5 K or Tg reductions as large as 17 K relative to Tg,bulk when films are made from methyl ethyl ketone or acetic acid solutions, respectively. A factor of 17 reduction of physical aging rate relative to that of neat, bulk P2VP is demonstrated in a 4 vol \% alumina/P2VP nanocomposite. This suggests that a strategy for achieving nonequilibrium, glassy polymeric systems that are stable or nearly stable to physical aging is to incorporate well-dispersed nanoparticles possessing attractive interfacial interactions with the polymer. {\textcopyright} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The ability to employ an intensive measurable, the excited-state fluorescence lifetime, in defining the glass transition temperature, Tg, of polymers is demonstrated and compared to the use of an extensive measurable, fluorescence intensity. In addition, intrinsic fluorescence from the phenyl groups in polystyrene is used to determine the Tg-confinement effect in films as thin as {\textasciitilde}15 nm. The decrease in Tg with decreasing film thickness (below \~{}60 nm) agrees well with results obtained by extrinsic pyrene fluorescence. Dye label fluorescence is used to quantify the enhancement in Tg observed with decreasing thickness (below {\textasciitilde}90 nm) in poly(methyl methacrylate) films; addition of 2{\textendash}4 wt\% dioctyl phthalate plasticizer reduces or eliminates the Tg-confinement effect in films down to 20 nm thickness. Intrinsic polystyrene fluorescence, which is sensitive to local conformation, is used to quantify the time scales (some tens of minutes) associated with stress relaxation in thin and ultrathin spin-coated films at Tg + 10 K. Finally, the shape of the fluorescence spectrum of pyrene doped at trace levels in polystyrene films and polystyrene-silica nanocomposites is used to determine effects of confinement on microenvironment polarity.},

In a series of styrene/n -butyl methacrylate (S/{nBMA}) random copolymers, T g breadths were observed to increase from \~{} 17{\textdegree} C in styrene-rich cases to almost 30{\textdegree} C in {nBMA}-rich cases, reflecting previous observations of significant nanoheterogeneity in {PnBMA} homopolymers. The derivative technique also revealed for the first time a substantial increase in glassy-state expansivity with increasing {nBMA} content in S/{nBMA} random copolymers, from 1.4{\texttimes}10-4 K-1 in {PS} to 3.5{\texttimes}10-4 K-1 in {PnBMA}. The first characterization of block copolymer T g {\textquoteright}s and T g breadths by ellipsometry is given, examining the impact of nanophase-segregated copolymer structure on ellipsometric measurements of glass transition. The results show that, while the technique is effective in detecting the two T g {\textquoteright}s expected in certain block copolymer systems, the details of the glass transition can become suppressed in ellipsometry measurements of a rubbery minor phase under conditions where the matrix is glassy; meanwhile, both transitions are easily discernible by differential scanning calorimetry. Finally, broad glass transition regions were measured in gradient copolymers, yielding in some cases extraordinary T g breadths of 69- 71{\textdegree} C , factors of 4-5 larger than the T g breadths of related homopolymers and random copolymers. Surprisingly, one gradient copolymer demonstrated a slightly narrower T g breadth than the S/{nBMA} random copolymers with the highest {nBMA} content. This highlights the fact that nanoheterogeneity relevant to the glass transition response in selected statistical copolymers can be comparable to or exceed that observed in moderately phase-segregated gradient copolymers.},

	abstract = {Using ellipsometry, we characterized the nanoconfinement effect on the glass transition temperature (T gof supported polystyrene ({PS}) films employing two methods: the intersection of fits to the temperature (Tdependences of rubbery- and glassy-state thicknesses, and the transition mid-point between rubbery- and glassy-state expansivities. The results demonstrate a strong effect of thickness: {\textbackslash}{ensuremathTg}(bulk)-Tg(23nm)=10o{\textbackslash}ensuremath T\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}\}(\{{\textbackslash}rm bulk\})-T\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm g\}\}(23\{{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mbox\{nm\}\})= 10 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} C. The T -range needed for accurate measurement increases significantly with decreasing thickness, an effect that arises from the broadening of the transition with confinement and a region below T g where expansivity slowly decreases with decreasing T . As determined from expansivities, the T g breadth triples in going from bulk films to a 21-nm-thick film; this broadening of the transition may be a more dramatic effect of confinement than the T g reduction itself. In contrast, there is little effect of confinement on the rubbery- and glassy-state expansivities. Compared with ellipsometry, T g {\textquoteright}s from fluorescence agree well in bulk films but yield lower values in nanoconfined films: T g(bulk) - T g(23 nm) = 15{\textdegree} C via fluorescence. This small difference in the T g confinement effect reflects differences in how fluorescence and ellipsometry report {\textquotedblleft}average T g {\textquotedblright} with confinement. With decreasing nanoscale thickness, fluorescence may slightly overweight the contribution of the free-surface layer while ellipsometry may evenly weight or underweight its contribution.},

These phenomena are consistent with the idea that a layer of roughly constant thickness, of order 10 nm, near the surface of the film has liquidlike thermal properties at all experimental temperatures.},

Polystyrene {MW} is shown to have no significant impact on the film thickness dependence of Tg ? Tg,bulk. In contrast, a small modification to the repeat unit structure of {PS} has a dramatic impact on the Tg-nanoconfinement effect. The strength of the thickness dependence of Tg is greater for poly(4-methylstyrene) (P4MS) than for {PS} and yet much greater for poly(4-tert-butylstyrene) ({PTBS}). The Tg reduction for {PTBS} is 47 K below Tg,bulk for a 25 nm thick film, with the onset thickness for confinement effects in {PTBS} being 300?400 nm. Measurements of the size of cooperatively rearranging regions, ?{CRR}, in bulk polymer systems at Tg reveal that {PS} {MW} has no significant effect on ?{CRR} unless {PS} is oligomeric or nearly oligomeric.

However, in neutral conjugated polyelectrolytes, the peaks of the absorption spectra showed a blue shift compared with those of the charged polyelectrolytes.

Phase transitions are the result of physical properties of a collection of particles depending on many-body interactions. In Chap. 2 we focused on two-body interactions. As we shall see, depletion effects are commonly not pair-wise additive. Therefore, the prediction of phase transitions of particles with depletion interaction is not straightforward. As a starting point a description is required for the thermodynamic properties of the pure colloidal dispersion. Here the colloid-atom analogy, recognized by Einstein and exploited by Perrin in his classical experiments, is very useful. Subsequently, we explain the basics of the free volume theory for the phase behaviour of colloids + depletants. In this chapter we treat only simplest type of depletant, the penetrable hard sphere.},

Herein, we demonstrate high-resolution patterning of multiple structural colours within seconds, based on successive tuning and fixing of colour using a single material along with a maskless lithography system. We have invented a material called 'M-Ink', the colour of which is tunable by magnetically changing the periodicity of the nanostructure and fixable by photochemically immobilizing those structures in a polymer network. We also demonstrate a flexible photonic crystal for the realization of structural colour printing. The simple, controllable and scalable structural colour printing scheme presented may have a significant impact on colour production for general consumer goods.},

The key parameter that determines the topology of the phase diagram is the ratio $\xi$=rg/a of the radius of gyration (rg) of the polymer molecules to the radius (a) of the colloidal particles. At small $\xi$, the addition of the polymer simply expands the colloidal fluid-crystal coexistence region of the pure hard-sphere system. For larger values of $\xi$, however, a three-phase coexistence of colloidal gas, liquid, and crystal phases is observed. The crossover between the two topologies is found at $\xi$\~{}0.25. These experimental observations are compared with the predictions of a recent statistical mechanical theory for such mixtures [Lekkerkerker et al., Europhys. Lett. 20, 559 (1992)].

These are shown to be almost invariably at a thermodynamic advantage over alternative lattice structures of the same number of atoms, at least for the Lennard-Jones potential in the harmonic-oscillator/rigid-rotor approximation. The dependence of thermodynamic functions upon cluster size appears to be essentially monotonic in the number of internal degrees of freedom; although there are certain exceptional structures, particularly with icosahedral symmetry, there proves to be little evidence for the occurrence of {\textquoteleft}magic numbers{\textquoteright} for stability at any temperature and within the size-range considered. Particular attention is given to the heat capacity of model systems in relation to their vibrational spectra. The Debye T 3 law appears reasonably well obeyed at low temperatures with no evidence for the existence of either {\textquoteleft}soft modes{\textquoteright} or distinct surface contributions. The results for the free energy of formation of minimal clusters $\Delta$G f are then applied to the computation of nucleation rates in terms of the Becker-D{\"o}ring-Volmer-Zeldovitch quasi-equilibrium theory. Gibbsian behaviour in the form of a maximum in the curve of $\Delta$G f versus size is observed with a critical nuclear size at realistic temperatures and pressures of the order of that predicted by macroscopic liquid-drop theories. These figures and those derived for nucleation rate and critical supersaturation appear remarkably insensitive to the details of the model used, in particular to the distinction between {\textquoteleft}microcrystalline{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}amorphous{\textquoteright} atomistic models. The general status of atomistic nucleation theory is critically examined in the light of these and similar results.},

For this purpose, nanoscaled Pd particles adhered and stabilized by poly(2-vinylpyridine)-block-polyisoprene (P2VP-b-{PI}), designated as Pd-(P2VP-b-{PI}), were prepared by reducing Pd2+ ions with 1-propanol at 85 {\textdegree}C for 45 h in a dilute solution of P2VP-b-{PI} and palladium acetylacetonate in benzene as a solvent and 1-propanol as a reducing agent. Thus, prepared Pd-(P2VP-b-{PI}) were purified to remove free P2VP-b-{PI} and unreacted salt, dissolved into a very dilute benzene solution containing ?10-5 wt \% of the particles, and transferred onto mica surface by dipping a sheet of mica into the solution. The surface of the sheet was further washed gently with a few drops (?0.1 {mL}/drop) of the benzene to obtain isolated Pd-(P2VP-b-{PI}) on the surface and observed by {AFM} with a tapping mode. The {AFM} images show isolated Pd-(P2VP-b-{PI}) with an average diameter of Pd particles of 8 nm and one to three adhered P2VP-b-{PI} chains. It was also revealed that only a part of segments of the chains adhered to the particles so that the particles had still a large surface area free from the polymers, and the adhered polymers had subchains free from the particles, thus stabilizing against coalescence of the particles due to entropic repulsion.},

	abstract = {The formation of small crystallites is governed by two competing factors: the free energy gained upon transferring constituent atoms, molecules or colloidal particles from the metastable liquid to the more stable solid, and the free energy needed to create the surface area of the crystallite. Because the ratio of surface area to bulk is large for small particles, small crystallites dissolve spontaneously under conditions where larger crystallites are stable and macroscopic crystal growth occurs only if spontaneously formed crystallites exceed a critical minimum size. On theoretical grounds, the probability of forming such critical crystal nuclei is expected to increase rapidly with supersaturation. However, experiments show that the rate of crystal nucleation in many systems goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. It is commonly assumed that the nucleation rate peaks because, even though the probability of forming critical nuclei increases with increasing concentration, the rate of growth of such nuclei decreases. Here we report simulations of crystal nucleation in suspensions of colloidal spheres with varying size distributions that show that the probability that critical nuclei will form itself goes through a maximum as the supersaturation is increased. We find that this effect, which is strongest for systems with the broadest particle size distribution, results from an increase with supersaturation of the solid{\textendash}liquid interfacial free energy. The magnitude of this effect suggests that vitrification at high supersaturations should yield colloidal glasses that are truly amorphous, rather than nano-crystalline.},

One type forms junction zones that lead to network formation and gelation, while the second type leads to the formation of isolated fibers of aggregated helices and inhibition of gelation.

Films were prepared by solvent casting followed by crosslinking at 80{\textdegree}C for 4 days.

Samples were diazeniumdiolated via exposure to pressurized {NO}. Cell compatibility was assessed by monitoring the proliferation of porcine aortic smooth muscle cells ({PASMC}) on the elastomers. Degradation in phosphate buffer saline ({PBS}) ({pH} = 7) at 37{\textdegree}C was evaluated for up to 6 weeks. The secondary amine-containing poly(diol citrate) films had a Young's modulus that ranged from 5.91 to 32.64 {MPa}, an ultimate tensile stress that ranged from 1.47 to 10.71 {MPa}, and an elongation at break from 200 to 260\%, depending on the content of secondary amine in the feed monomer. These elastomers were degradable and compatible with {PASMC}. Furthermore, degradation rate was found to be independent of the content of secondary amines in the prepolymer. The {NO} release from diazeniumdiolated films and {ePTFE} grafts was sustained for two days. In conclusion, these novel diazeniumdiolated polyester elastomers may be useful in medical devices that require blood contact or control of cell proliferation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The tensile strength of poly(diol citrates) were as high as 11.15{\textpm}2.62 {MPa} and Young's modulus ranged from 1.60{\textpm}0.05 to 13.98{\textpm}3.05 {MPa} under the synthesis conditions that were investigated.

The mechanical properties, degradation and surface characteristics of poly(diol citrates) could be controlled by choosing different diols as well as by controlling the cross-link density of the polyester network. Various types of poly(diol citrate) scaffolds were fabricated to demonstrate their processing potential. These scaffolds were soft and could recover from deformation. In vitro and in vivo evaluation using cell culture and subcutaneous implantation, respectively, confirmed cell and tissue compatibility.

They were, however, limited by the frequent occurrence of restenosis owing to smooth muscle proliferation, and resultant neointimal hyperplasia and target lesion revascularization. By coating stents with drugs that target smooth muscle cell proliferation, it has been possible to considerably attenuate in-stent restenosis. This innovative technology still has shortcomings, however, and novel approaches are needed to improve the safety and efficacy of {DES}. The main components that determine the performance of a stent are the stent backbone, active drug, polymer and delivery system, and each of these factors need to be examined to optimize {DES} platforms. Improvements include the use of new coating technologies, bioabsorbable stents, non-drug-based stent coatings, and tailored lesion therapy.

	abstract = {The establishment and maintenance of functional endothelial cells ({ECs}) on an engineered surface is central to tissue engineering.  As the field advances, the role of cellular mechanisms, particularly the adhesive interaction between the surface of implantable devices and biological systems, becomes more relevant in both research and clinical practice.  Knowledge of these interactions can address many fundamental biological questions and would provide key design parameters for medical implants.  It has been shown that {EC} functionality and adhesivity, crucial for the re-endothelialization process, can be induced by nanotopographical modification.  Therefore, the goal of this dissertation research was to develop an ensemble surface composing of nanoscale features for the enhancement of endothelial cell adhesion.  Without adhesion, subsequent vital mechanism involved in cell alignment, elongation or spreading, proliferation, migration, and {ECM} proteins deposition will not occur.Experiments in support of this goal were broken down into three specific aims.  The first aim was to characterize and develop a size-dependent self-assembly ({SDSA}) nanoarray of Octamer transcription factor 4 as a demonstration to the fabrication of nanoscale feature surface.  This nanoparticle array platform was a pilot studied for the second aim, which was the development of an ensemble surface of nanoscale features for endothelial cell adhesion.  The third aim was to evaluate and assess {EC} response to the ensemble surface.Hence, we developed an ensemble surface composed of nanoscale features and adhesive elements for {EC} adhesivity.  By using shear stress as a detachment force, we demonstrated greater cell retention by the ensemble surface than uniform controls.  Adhesive interactions and cellular migration through integrin expressions, which are critical to tissue development and wound healing process was also observed.  Furthermore, cell viability was relatively sustainable, as indicated by the low expression of apoptotic signaling molecules.  The findings presented within this dissertation research can be applicable to blood-contact medical implants and possess the potential for future clinical translation.},

	abstract = {Retinoids, the metabolically-active structural derivatives of vitamin A, are critical signaling molecules in many fundamental biological processes including cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. Emerging evidence, both clinical and molecular, implicates retinoids in atherosclerosis and other vasculoproliferative disorders such as restenosis. Although the data from clinical trials examining effect of vitamin A and vitamin precursors on cardiac events have been contradictory, this data does suggest that retinoids do influence fundamental processes relevant to atherosclerosis. Preclinical animal model and cellular studies support these concepts. Retinoids exhibit complex effects on proliferation, growth, differentiation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells ({VSMC}), including responses to injury and atherosclerosis. Retinoids also appear to exert important inhibitory effects on thrombosis and inflammatory responses relevant to atherogenesis. Recent studies suggest retinoids may also be involved in vascular calcification and endothelial function, for example, by modulating nitric oxide pathways. In addition, established retinoid effects on lipid metabolism and adipogenesis may indirectly influence inflammation and atherosclerosis. Collectively, these observations underscore the scope and complexity of retinoid effects relevant to vascular disease. Additional studies are needed to elucidate how context and metabolite-specific retinoid effects affect atherosclerosis.

	abstract = {Objective 
In France, despite a high intake of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat, the cardiovascular death rate is one of the lowest among developed countries. This {\textquotedblleft}French paradox{\textquotedblright} has been postulated to be related to the high red wine intake in France. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of resveratrol, a major polyphenol component of red wine, on vascular smooth muscle cell ({SMC}) proliferation in vitro. 
Methods 
{SMCs} were exposed to 10-6 to 10-4 M resveratrol and cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting. Cell cycle analysis was done by treating cells with propidium iodide followed by flow-activated cell sorting. Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated {dUTP}-biotin nick-end labeling staining. 
Results 
We demonstrate that resveratrol inhibited bovine aortic {SMC} proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The lowest concentration of resveratrol resulting in a significant decrease in {SMC} proliferation compared with control was 10-5 M. By flow cytometry, we observed a block in the G1-S phase of the {SMC} cycle. Resveratrol treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent apoptosis of {SMCs} but had no effects on {SMC} morphology. 
Conclusion 
The results indicated that vascular {SMC} proliferation could be inhibited by resveratrol through a block on G1-S phase and by an increase in apoptosis. It supports the conjecture that red wine consumption may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular mortality. 
Clinical Relevance 
Our results suggest that resveratrol inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, smooth muscle cell proliferation, which may help to partially explain a beneficial effect of wine drinking. This inhibition is related to an early block in the cell cycle and also to a dose-dependent apoptotic effect. The present study demonstrates that resveratrol not only is an indirect marker of a healthy life style and alimentation but may also be directly responsible for the French paradox.},

	abstract = {Nitric oxide ({NO})-based therapies effectively inhibit neointimal hyperplasia in animal models of arterial injury and bypass grafting, but are not available clinically. We created a simple, effective, locally applied {NO}-eluting therapy to prevent restenosis after vascular procedures. We investigated the efficacy of perivascular delivery of two distinctly different diazeniumdiolate {NO} donors, 1-[2-(carboxylato)pyrrolidin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate ({PROLI}/{NO}) (short half-life) and diazeniumdiolated poly(acrylonitrile) ({PAN}/{NO}) (long half-life), in powder or gel form (30\% poloxamer 407), at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia using the rat carotid artery injury model. Two weeks postinjury, all of the {NO}-eluting therapies successfully reduced neointimal hyperplasia. However, most dramatically, {PROLI}/{NO} powder reduced intimal area by 91.2\% (p \&lt; 0.05) versus injury alone. {PROLI}/{NO} powder was noted to reduce the medial area (40.2\% vs injury alone, p \&lt; 0.05), whereas other groups showed no such effect. Three days postinjury, each {NO} treatment group significantly reduced cellular proliferation. However, inflammatory markers revealed a distinct pattern: {PAN}/{NO} groups displayed increased leukocyte infiltration (p \&lt; 0.05), whereas {PROLI}/{NO} groups displayed less macrophage infiltration (p \&lt; 0.05). In conclusion, perivascular delivery of diazeniumdiolate {NO} donors in powder or gel form effectively inhibits neointimal hyperplasia. Application of short-acting {PROLI}/{NO} powder most effectively inhibited neointimal hyperplasia and inflammation and may represent a simple, clinically applicable {NO}-eluting therapy to prevent neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis after open vascular interventions.},

	abstract = {Owing to their noninvasive nature, coronary artery stents have become popular demand for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Late restenosis, in-stent restenosis, and late thrombosis, all mediated by the denuded endothelium, represent the most recurrent failures of vascular stent induction. Higher patency rates of stents can be achieved by restoring the native internal environment of the vessel{\textemdash}an endothelium monolayer. This active organ inhibits the inflammatory reaction to injury responsible for thrombus and intimal hyperplasia, thereby providing a novel therapeutic option to combat the unacceptably high prevalence of restenosis. As the climax of the nanotechnology era approaches, tissue engineering is being explored by means of exploiting the multipotent abilities of stem cells and their adherence to bioactive surface nanocomposite polymers. The endothelium can be reconstructed from neighboring intact endothelium and adherence of circulating endothelium progenitor cells. The latter takes place via a series of signaling events: mobilization, adhesion, chemoattraction, migration, proliferation, and finally their differentiation in mature endothelial cells. A nanotopography surface can orchestrate endothelium formation, attributable to cellular interactions promoted by its nanosize. This review encompasses the prospect of in situ endothelialization, the mechanisms regulating the process, and the advantages of using a new generation of bioactive nanocomposite materials for coating metal stent scaffolds.},

In this review, we summarize the cardiovascular effects of resveratrol with emphasis on the molecular targets of the compound. In this regard, resveratrol stimulates endothelial production of nitric oxide, reduces oxidative stress, inhibits vascular inflammation and prevents platelet aggregation. In animal models of cardiovascular disease, resveratrol protects the heart from ischemia{\textendash}reperfusion injury, reduces blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive animals, and slows the progression of atherosclerosis. A number of direct and indirect target molecules mediating the aforementioned cardiovascular effects of resveratrol have been identified. These include, among others, the estrogen receptor $\alpha$, the adenosine receptors, the cyclooxygenase 1, the histone/protein deacetylase sirtuin 1, the {AMP}-activated protein kinase, the Akt kinase, the nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2, and {NF}-$\kappa$B.

However, restenosis, incomplete endothelialization, and thrombosis hamper the long term clinical success. As a solution to meet these current challenges, we have developed a native endothelial {ECM} mimicking self-assembled nanofibrous matrix to serve as a new treatment model. The nanofibrous matrix is formed by self-assembly of peptide amphiphiles ({PAs}), which contain nitric oxide ({NO}) donating residues, endothelial cell adhesive ligands composed of {YIGSR} peptide sequence, and enzyme-mediated degradable sites. {NO} was successfully released from the nanofibrous matrix rapidly within 48 h, followed by sustained release over period of 30 days. The {NO} releasing nanofibrous matrix demonstrated a significantly enhanced proliferation of endothelial cells (51 {\textpm} 3\% to 67 {\textpm} 2\%) but reduced proliferation of smooth muscle cells (35 {\textpm} 2\% to 16 {\textpm} 3\%) after 48 h of incubation. There was also a 150-fold decrease in platelet attachment on the {NO} releasing nanofibrous matrix (470 {\textpm} 220 platelets/cm2) compared to the collagen-I (73 {\textpm} 22 {\texttimes} 103 platelets/cm2) coated surface. The nanofibrous matrix has the potential to be applied to various cardiovascular implants as a self-assembled coating, thereby providing a native endothelial extracellular matrix ({ECM}) mimicking environment.},

	abstract = {Objective 
Nitric oxide ({NO}) has been shown to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia after arterial interventions in several animal models. To date, however, {NO}-based therapies have not been used in the clinical arena. Our objective was to combine nanofiber delivery vehicles with {NO} chemistry to create a novel, more potent {NO}-releasing therapy that can be used clinically. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the perivascular application of spontaneously self-assembling {NO}-releasing nanofiber gels. Our hypothesis was that this application would prevent neointimal hyperplasia. 
Methods 
Gels consisted of a peptide amphiphile, heparin, and a diazeniumdiolate {NO} donor (1-[N-(3-Aminopropyl)-N-(3-ammoniopropyl)]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate [{DPTA}/{NO}] or disodium 1-[(2-Carboxylato)pyrrolidin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate [{PROLI}/{NO}]). Nitric oxide release from the gels was evaluated by the Griess reaction, and scanning electron microscopy confirmed nanofiber formation. Vascular smooth muscle cell ({VSMC}) proliferation and cell death were assessed in vitro by 3H-thymidine incorporation and Personal Cell Analysis ({PCA}) system (Guava Technologies, Hayward, Calif). For the in vivo work, gels were modified by reducing the free-water content. Neointimal hyperplasia after periadventitial gel application was evaluated using the rat carotid artery injury model at 14 days (n = 6 per group). Inflammation and proliferation were examined in vivo with immunofluorescent staining against {CD}45, {ED}1, and Ki67 at 3 days (n = 2 per group), and graded by blinded observers. Endothelialization was assessed by Evans blue injection at 7 days (n = 3 per group). 
Results 
Both {DPTA}/{NO} and {PROLI}/{NO}, combined with the peptide amphiphile and heparin, formed nanofiber gels and released {NO} for 4 days. In vitro, {DPTA}/{NO} inhibited {VSMC} proliferation and induced cell death to a greater extent than {PROLI}/{NO}. However, the {DPTA}/{NO} nanofiber gel only reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 45\% (intima/media [I/M] area ratio, 0.45 {\textpm} 0.07), whereas the {PROLI}/{NO} nanofiber gel reduced neointimal hyperplasia by 77\% (I/M area ratio, 0.19 {\textpm} 0.03, P \&lt; .05) vs control (injury alone I/M area ratio, 0.83 {\textpm} 0.07; P \&lt; .05). Both {DPTA}/{NO} and {PROLI}/{NO} nanofiber gels significantly inhibited proliferation in vivo (1.06 {\textpm} 0.30 and 0.19 {\textpm} 0.11 vs injury alone, 2.02 {\textpm} 0.20, P \&lt; .05), yet had minimal effect on apoptosis. Only the {PROLI}/{NO} nanofiber gel inhibited inflammation (monocytes and leukocytes). Both {NO}-releasing nanofiber gels stimulated re-endothelialization. 
Conclusions 
Perivascular application of {NO}-releasing self-assembling nanofiber gels is an effective and simple therapy to prevent neointimal hyperplasia after arterial injury. Our study demonstrates that the {PROLI}/{NO} nanofiber gel most effectively prevented neointimal hyperplasia and resulted in less inflammation than the {DPTA}/{NO} nanofiber gel. This therapy has great clinical potential to prevent neointimal hyperplasia after open vascular interventions in patients. 
 Clinical relevance 
Atherosclerosis affects \&gt;79 million Americans, many of whom require arterial intervention; unfortunately, treatment modalities often fail secondary to the development of neointimal hyperplasia, necessitating reintervention. It is well established that nitric oxide ({NO}) inhibits neointimal hyperplasia, but no {NO}-based therapies have been clinically applied owing to various concerns. In this study, we demonstrated inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in the rat carotid artery balloon-injury model using the local application of a gel made from {NO} and self-assembling nanofibers. By inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent restenosis after arterial interventions, we aim to improve long-term patency rates and reduce the number of repeat interventions.},

A decade ago, a value of about 1 $\mu$M seemed reasonable based on early electrode measurements and a provisional estimate of the potency of {NO} for its guanylyl cyclase-coupled receptors, which mediate physiological {NO} signal transduction. Since then, numerous efforts to measure {NO} concentrations directly using electrodes in cells and tissues have yielded an irreconcilably large spread of values. In compensation, data from several alternative approaches have now converged to provide a more coherent picture. These approaches include the quantitative analysis of {NO}-activated guanylyl cyclase, computer modelling based on the type, activity and amount of {NO} synthase enzyme contained in cells, the use of novel biosensors to monitor {NO} release from single endothelial cells and neurones, and the use of guanylyl cyclase as an endogenous {NO} biosensor in tissue subjected to a variety of challenges.

Physiol. 83(6): 1968{\textendash}1975, 1997.{\textemdash}We examined the pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic effects of administering soluble nitric oxide ({NO}) donor compounds ({NO}/nucleophile adducts, i.e., {NONOates}) directly into the trachea of animals with experimentally induced pulmonary hypertension. Steady-state pulmonary hypertension was created by using the thromboxane agonist U-46619. Yorkshire pigs were randomly assigned to one of four groups: group 1, intratracheal saline (control; n = 8);group 2, intratracheal sodium nitroprusside (n = 6);group 3, intratracheal ethylputreanine {NONOate} (n = 6); andgroup 4, intratracheal 2-(dimethylamino)-ethylputreanine {NONOate} ({DMAEP}/{NO};n = 6). Pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics were monitored after drug instillation.Group 4 had significant reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance index ({PVRI}) at all time points compared with steady state and compared with group 1 (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas systemic vascular resistance index did not change. The mean change in mean pulmonary arterial pressure in group 4 was -33.1 {\textpm} 1.2\% compared with +6.4 {\textpm} 1.3\% in group 1(P {\textless} 0.001), and the mean change in mean arterial pressure was -9.3 {\textpm} 0.7\% compared with a control value of -0.9 {\textpm} 0.5\% (P {\textless} 0.05). Groups 2 and 3 had significant decreases in both {PVRI} and systemic vascular resistance index compared with steady state and with group 1. In conclusion, intratracheal instillation of a polar-charged tertiary amine {NONOate} {DMAEP}/{NO} results in the selective reduction of {PVRI}. Intermittent intratracheal instillation of selective {NONOates} may be an alternative to continuously inhaled {NO} in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.},

However, the in vivo biological effects of resveratrol appear strongly limited by its low bioavailability, which is a barrier to the development of therapeutic applications. In this context, an increasing number of recent studies have aimed at designing novel resveratrol formulations to overcome its poor solubility, limited stability, high metabolization and weak bioavailability. This review outlines physicochemical and pharmacokinetic limitations to resveratrol bioavailability, describes formulations tested for resveratrol administration, controlled release and targeting, and identifies future opportunities for resveratrol delivery.},

Seven copolymers were prepared based on the nonionic hydrophobic n-butyl methacrylate ({BuMA}), the ionizable hydrophilic and thermoresponsive 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate ({DMAEMA}) and the nonionic hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol)methyl methacrylate ({PEGMA}). In particular, one diblock copolymer and six tricomponent copolymers of different architectures and compositions, one random and five triblock copolymers, were synthesized. The polymers and their precursors were characterized in terms of their molecular weight and composition using gel permeation chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Aqueous solutions of the polymers were studied by turbidimetry, hydrogen ion titration, and light scattering to determine their cloud points, {pKas}, and hydrodynamic diameters and investigate the effect of the polymers' composition and architecture. The thermoresponsive behavior of the copolymers was also studied. By increasing the temperature, all polymer solutions became more viscous, but only one polymer, the one with the highest content of the hydrophobic {BuMA}, formed a stable physical gel. Interestingly, the thermoresponsive behavior of these triblock copolymers was affected not only by the terpolymers' composition but also by the terpolymers' architecture. These findings can facilitate the design and engineering of injectable copolymers for tissue engineering that could enable the in situ formation of physical gels at body temperature. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The block copolymers with various molecular weights and compositions were synthesized through ring-opening polymerization of 2-ethoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane ({EEP}) and 2-isopropoxy-2-oxo-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane ({PEP}) using poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether ({mPEG}) as the initiator and stannous octoate as the catalyst. The obtained block polymers exhibited thermo-induced self-assembly behavior, demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and {UV}?vis measurements using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as the probe. It was found that the critical aggregation temperature ({CAT}) of the block copolymers shifted to higher temperature with increased molecular weight of {mPEG}, while copolymerization with more hydrophobic monomer {PEP} led to lower transition temperature; thus, the {CAT} can be conveniently adjusted. The block copolymers did not induce significant hemolysis and plasma protein precipitation. In vitro {MTT} and live/dead staining assays indicated they are biocompatible, and the biocompatibility was further demonstrated in vivo by the absence of local acute inflammatory response in mouse muscle following intramuscular injection. Unlike most frequently studied thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), polyphosphoesters were hydrolytically degradable in aqueous solution that was proven by gel permeation chromatography and {NMR} analyses, and the degradation products were proven to be nontoxic to {HEK}293 cells. Therefore, with good biocompatibility and thermoresponsiveness, these biodegradable block copolymers of {mPEG} and polyphosphoesters are promising as stimuli-responsive materials for biomedical applications.},

Loading and release of model drugs into/from the hydrogel particles were evaluated. Thermosensitive particles were stabilized by cross-linkers, the most feasible of which was salicylic acid ({SA}). At 23{\textdegree}C, below the lower critical solution temperature ({LCST}) of the thermosensitive polymers, stability of the hydrogels was poor, whereas at 37{\textdegree}C stable hydrogel particles were formed. All the drugs and also the cross-linker ({SA}) were released more efficiently from the {PVCL} particles compared to the {PVCL}-graft-C11EO42 particles. Drug concentration and {pH} affected clearly the rate and extent of drug release in physiological buffer. The higher drug release from the {PVCL} was based on the more open gel-like structure as opposed to {PVCL}-graft-C11EO42 particles. Complex formation between the cross-linker and the polymers was due to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of {SA} and H-bond acceptors of the {PVCL}. In the case of {PVCL}-graft-C11EO42, the ethylene oxide chain provided more opportunities for H-bonding in comparison to the pure {PVCL}, creating more stable complexes (more tightly packed particles) leading to sustained drug release. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 97:4783{\textendash}4793, 2008},

Thermo-responsive cell culture carriers are widely used for non-enzymatic harvest of cell sheets. The current study presents a novel thermo-responsive carrier based on simultaneous electron beam immobilization and cross-linking of poly(vinyl methyl ether) ({PVME}) on polymeric surfaces, which allows one to adjust layer thickness, stiffness, switching amplitude and functionalization with bioactive molecules to meet cell type specific requirements. The efficacy of this approach for {HCEC}, which require elaborate cell culture conditions and are strongly adherent to the substratum, is demonstrated.

Here, we survey experimental and theoretical studies of nonpolar solute partitioning into water. We note that the hydrophobic effect is not just due to ?water ordering? and not merely due to small size effects of water. The properties vary substantially with temperature and solute shape.

	abstract = {Although cell sheet tissue engineering is a potent and promising method for tissue engineering, an increase of mechanical strength of a cell sheet is needed for easy manipulation of it during transplantation or 3D tissue fabrication. Previously, we developed a cell sheet{\textendash}polymer film complex that had enough mechanical strength that can be manipulated even by tweezers (Fujita et al., 2009. Biotechnol Bioeng 103(2): 370{\textendash}377). We confirmed the polymer film involving a temperature sensitive polymer and extracellular matrix ({ECM}) proteins could be removed by lowering temperature after transplantation, and its potential use in regenerative medicine was demonstrated. However, the use of {ECM} proteins conflicted with high stability in long-term storage and low cost. In the present study, to overcome these drawbacks, we employed the oxygen plasma treatment instead of using the {ECM} proteins. A cast and dried film of thermoresponsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide ({PNIPAAm}) was fabricated and treated with high-intensity oxygen plasma. The cells became possible to adhere to the oxygen plasma-treated {PNIPAAm} surface, whereas could not to the inherent surface of bulk {PNIPAAm} without treatment. Characterizations of the treated surface revealed the surface had high stability. The surface roughness, wettability, and composition were changed, depending on the plasma intensity. Interestingly, although bulk {PNIPAAm} layer had thermoresponsiveness and dissolved below lower critical solution temperature ({LCST}), it was found that the oxygen plasma-treated {PNIPAAm} surface lost its thermoresponsiveness and remained insoluble in water below {LCST} as a thin layer. Skeletal muscle C2C12 cells could be cultured on the oxygen plasma-treated {PNIPAAm} surface, a skeletal muscle cell sheet with the insoluble thin layer could be released in the medium, and thus the possibility of use of the cell sheet for transplantation was demonstrated.

This behaviour can be utilised for the preparation of so-called {\textquoteleft}smart{\textquoteright} drug delivery systems, which mimic biological response behaviour to a certain extent. The possible environmental conditions to use for this purpose are limited due to the biomedical setting of drug delivery as application. Different organs, tissues and cellular compartments may have large differences in {pH}, which makes the {pH} a suitable stimulus. Therefore the majority of examples, discussed in this paper, deal with {pH}-responsive drug delivery system. Thermo-responsive polymer is also covered to a large extent, as well as double-responsive system. The physico-chemical behaviour underlying the phase transition will be discussed in brief.

There are several possible mechanisms that lead to in situ gel formation: solvent exchange, {UV}-irradiation, ionic cross-linkage, {pH} change, and temperature modulation. The thermosensitive approach can be advantageous for particular applications as it does not require organic solvents, co-polymerization agents, or an externally applied trigger for gelation. In the last 2 decades, several thermosensitive formulations have been proposed. This manuscript focuses on aqueous polymeric solutions that form implants in situ in response to temperature change, generally from ambient to body temperature. It mainly reviews the characterization and use of polysaccharides, N-isopropylacrylamide copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) (poloxamer) and its copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)/(d,l-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) copolymers, and thermosensitive liposome-based systems.},

Synthetic hydrogels offer a possibly effective and convenient way to administer these compounds.

These materials can be synthesized to respond to a number of physiological stimuli present in the body, such as {pH}, ionic strength and temperature.

This {PIPAAm}-grafted surface exhibited hydrophobic surface properties at temperatures over the {LCST} and hydrophilic surface properties below the {LCST}. Endothelial cells and hepatocytes attached and proliferated on {PIPAAmgrafted} surfaces at 37 {\textdegree} C, above the {LCST}. The cultured cells were readily detached from these surfaces by lowering the incubation temperature without the usual damage associated with trypsinization. In this case, the optimum temperature for cell detachment was 10 {\textdegree} C for hepatocytes and 20 {\textdegree} C for endothelial cells. Cell detachment was partially inhibited by sodium azide treatment, suggesting that cell metabolism directly affects cell detachment. Morphological changes of the adherent cells during cell detachment experiments indicated further involvement of active cellular metabolic processes. Cells detached from hydrophobic-hydrophilic {PIPAAm} surfaces not only via reduced cell surface interactions caused by the spontaneous hydration of grafted {PIPAAm} chains, but also by active cell morphological changes which were a function of cell metabolism.},

To obtain {pH}-induced thermosensitive functionality at physiological temperature, 5 mol\% of acrylic acid ({AAc}) and N, N-dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate ({DMA}) were incorporated into {PNIPAm} chain by their copolymerization. It is found that the {IPN} hydrogels show {pH}-induced thermosensitivity at physiological temperature. When the amphiphilic gels with {IPN} structure were immersed in water, the hydrophobic moieties formed by {PEA} have the potential to act as reservoirs for hydrophobic drugs, from which drug may be released slowly. Using drug daidzein ({DAI}) as a model molecule, controlled release behaviors of the {IPNs} were investigated. It is found that the presence of permanently hydrophobic {PEA} network can indeed slow the release rate of {DAI} and to some extent overcome disadvantageous burst effect of {PNIPAm}-based networks in hydration state. The release kinetics of {DAI} from the {IPNs} seems to follow pseudo-zero-order release character, regardless of the hydrogels in swollen or shrunken state.},

The advantage of this system is that cells cultured on such temperature-responsive surfaces can be recovered as single cells and/or confluent cell sheets, while keeping the deposited extracellular matrix intact, simply by lowering the temperature without conventional enzymatic treatment. Here, we focus and compare various methods of producing temperature-responsive surfaces for controlling cell attachment/detachment.

	abstract = {In this study, we synthesized and characterized a series of macromers based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) that undergo thermally induced physical gelation and, following chemical modification, can be chemically cross-linked. Macromers with number average molecular weights typically ranging from 2000?3500 Da were synthesized via free radical polymerization from, in addition to N-isopropylacrylamide, pentaerythritol diacrylate monostearate, a bifunctional monomer containing a long hydrophobic chain, acrylamide, a hydrophilic monomer, and hydroxyethyl acrylate, a hydrophilic monomer used to provide hydroxyl groups for further chemical modification. Results indicated that the hydrophobic?hydrophilic balance achieved by varying the relative concentrations of comonomers used during synthesis was an important parameter in controlling the transition temperature of the macromers in solution and stability of the resultant gels. Storage moduli of the macromers increased over 4 orders of magnitude once gelation occurred above the transition temperature. Furthermore, chemical cross-linking of these macromers resulted in gels with increased stability compared to uncross-linked controls. These results demonstrate the feasibility of synthesizing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based macromers that undergo tandem gelation and establish key criteria relating to the transition temperature and stability of these materials. The data suggest that these materials may be attractive substrates for tissue engineering and cellular delivery applications as the combination of mechanistically independent gelation techniques used in tandem may offer superior materials with regard to gelation kinetics and stability.},

It has been demonstrated experimentally that {PNIPAM} dissolved in aqueous solution undergoes a collapse transition from coil to globule on increasing temperature above the $\theta$-point. By a careful reviewing of existing experimental data, we emphasize that such coil to globule collapse has to be considered an intramolecular first-order transition, analogous to the cold renaturation of small globular proteins. The main theoretical approaches to the coil to globule collapse in homopolymers are discussed briefly, and a critical comparison between the existing models is performed. We point out that, as a general result, the coil to globule collapse is expected to be a first-order transition for rigid and semi-rigid macromolecules. Finally, taking advantage of the analogy between the coil to globule collapse of {PNIPAM} and the cold renaturation of small globular proteins, we try to clarify some important and intriguing aspects of protein thermodynamics. This leads to the conclusion that the amphiphilic nature of polypeptide chain plays the fundamental role for the existence of two temperature-induced conformational transitions.},

In order to evaluate nanoparticle formulations for biological efficacy, monolayer cell cultures are typically used as in vitro testing platforms. However, these studies sometimes poorly predict the efficacy of the drug in vivo. The poor in vitro and in vivo correlation may be attributed in part to the inability of two-dimensional cultures to reproduce extracellular barriers, and may also be due to differences in cell phenotype between cells cultured as monolayers and cells in native tissue. In order to more accurately predict in vivo results, it is desirable to test nanoparticle therapeutics in cells cultured in three-dimensional (3-D) models that mimic in vivo conditions. In this review, we discuss some 3-D culture systems that have been used to assess nanoparticle delivery and highlight several implications for nanoparticle design garnered from studies using these systems. While our focus will be on nanoparticle drug formulations, many of the systems discussed here could, or have been, used for the assessment of small molecule or peptide/protein drugs. We also offer some examples of advancements in 3-D culture that could provide even more highly predictive data for designing nanoparticle therapeutics for in vivo applications.},

In our point of view, the whole range of applications and physical forms of stimuli responsive polymers will be elucidated, which is more helpful to design new approaches because the basic concepts and mechanisms are systematically connected. This means that any new advanced concepts and mechanisms can be utilized in a variety of other applications as well as other physical forms.

	abstract = {Introduction: Local delivery of antimitotic agents is a potential therapeutic strategy for protection of injured coronary vasculature against intimal hyperplasia and restenosis. This study sought to establish the principle that thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) co-polymer films can be used to deliver, in a controlled manner, an antimitotic agent to vascular smooth muscle cells ({VSMC}). Methods: A series of co-polymer films was prepared, using varying ratios (w/w) of N-isopropylacrylamide ({NiPAAm}) monomer to N-tert-butylacrylamide ({NtBAAm}) and loaded with the antimitotic agent colchicine (100 nmol/film) at room temperature. Results: The extent of colchicine release at 37 {\textdegree}C was inversely proportional to the amount of {NtBAAm} in co-polymer films: release after 48 h from 85:15, 65:35 and 50:50 ({NiPAAm}:{NtBAAm}) films was 26, 17 and 0.5 nmol, respectively. In cytotoxicity studies, when medium incubated with co-polymers for 24 h (in the absence of colchicine) was further incubated with target bovine aortic smooth muscle cells ({BASMC}), no loss of cell viability occurred. Colchicine released from all three co-polymer films significantly inhibited proliferation and random migration of {BASMC}: 100 {nM} colchicine (released from 65:35 {NiPAAm}:{NtBAAm}) reduced cell proliferation to 25.7{\textpm}1.7\% of levels seen in the absence of colchicine (control) and random cell migration to 37.7{\textpm}5.7\% of control (mean{\textpm}S.E.M., n=3, P\&lt;.01 and P\&lt;.05, respectively). The magnitudes of these effects were comparable to those seen in separate experiments with native colchicine and were observed in samples of released colchicine which had been stored at -20 {\textdegree}C for up to 6 months. Conclusions: This study has shown that the release of the antimitotic agent colchicine, from {NiPAAm}/{NtBAAm} co-polymer films can be manipulated by changes in co-polymer composition. Furthermore, such drug released at 37 {\textdegree}C retains comparable bioactivity to that of native colchicine.},

Advances in this field are particularly relevant to applications in the areas of biosensing, chromatography, drug delivery and regenerative medicine. The control over biomolecule adsorption and desorption processes at interfaces is often used to control subsequent events such as cell{\textendash}surface interactions. Considerable research interest has been directed at systems that can be reversibly switched between interacting and non-interacting states and used thus for switching, on and off, bio-interfacial interactions such as protein adsorption. Such switchable coatings often incorporate features such as temporal resolution, spatial resolution and reversibility. Here we review recent literature on switchable coatings that employ stimuli such as light, temperature, electric potential, {pH} and ionic strength to control protein adsorption/desorption and cell attachment/detachment en route to the development of next-generation smart bio-interfaces.},

	abstract = {Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) ({PNIPAAm}) copolymers were synthesized in order to obtain co-polymers with a phase transition temperature slightly higher than the physiological temperature, as required by a new drug delivery concept described in a previous paper. Six hydrophilic comonomers bringing about a rise of the phase transition temperature were evaluated. The synthesized copolymers were characterized and the influence of the type and of the amount of the used comonomer on the phase transition temperature was discussed. Among the comonomers, Acrylamide ({AAm}), N-methyl-N-vinylacetamide ({MVA}), N-vinylacetamide ({NVA}), and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone ({VPL}) were found to be capable to raise the phase transition temperature to a value slightly higher than 37 {\textdegree}C and to have adequate phase transition behavior. The selected four copolymers were subjected to an additional purification step that should make them fit to use as a controlling agent in drug delivery systems.},

The self-assembly of a {DNA}-origami structure is a straightforward process in which a long single-stranded scaffold (often from the phage M13mp18) is folded into basically any desired shape with the help of a multitude of short helper strands. This approach enables the ready generation of objects with an addressable surface area of a few thousand nm2 and with a single {\textquotedblleft}pixel{\textquotedblright} resolution of about 6 nm. The process is rapid, puts low demands on experimental conditions, and delivers target products in high yields. These features make {DNA} origami the method of choice in structural {DNA} nanotechnology when two- and three-dimensional objects are desired.

Here we report a general method for arranging single-walled carbon nanotubes in two dimensions using {DNA} origami{\textemdash}a technique in which a long single strand of {DNA} is folded into a predetermined shape. We synthesize rectangular origami templates ({\textasciitilde}75 nm {\texttimes} 95 nm) that display two lines of single-stranded {DNA} {\textquoteleft}hooks{\textquoteright} in a cross pattern with {\textasciitilde}6 nm resolution. The perpendicular lines of hooks serve as sequence-specific binding sites for two types of nanotubes, each functionalized non-covalently with a distinct {DNA} linker molecule. The hook-binding domain of each linker is protected to ensure efficient hybridization. When origami templates and {DNA}-functionalized nanotubes are mixed, strand displacement-mediated deprotection and binding aligns the nanotubes into cross-junctions. Of several cross-junctions synthesized by this method, one demonstrated stable field-effect transistor-like behaviour. In such organizations of electronic components, {DNA} origami serves as a programmable nanobreadboard; thus, {DNA} origami may allow the rapid prototyping of complex nanotube-based structures.},

Sweep times of 1 s do not yield a steady state; however sweep times of 450 s for the bias voltage secure a steady state. The thermionic emission and hopping conduction models yield similar barriers of approximately 0.7 {eV} at low voltages. For high voltages, the hopping conduction mechanism yields a barrier of 0.9 {eV} and the thermionic emission yields 1.1 {eV}. The experimental data set suggests that the dominant conduction mechanism is hopping in the range 280-320 K.

Spectra were collected on sample volumes (1 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}6 M or 15 ng/$\mu$L) similar to those that would be found in a museum setting and were found to be higher in resolution and consistency than those collected on silver island films ({AgIFs}). In fact, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this work presents the highest resolution spectrum of the artists' material cochineal to date. In order to determine an optimized {SERS} system for dye identification, experiments were conducted in which laser excitation wavelengths were matched with correlating {AgFON} localized surface plasmon resonance ({LSPR}) maxima. Enhancements of approximately two orders of magnitude were seen when resonance {SERS} conditions were met in comparison to non-resonance {SERS} conditions. Finally, because most samples collected in a museum contain multiple dyestuffs, {AgFONs} were employed to simultaneously identify individual dyes within several dye mixtures. These results indicate that {AgFONs} have great potential to be used to identify not only real artwork samples containing a single dye but also samples containing dyes mixtures.},

This allowed to limit the number of extractions of the micro-samples for the complementary Raman measurements thus assuring the practically non-destructive character of the entire analysis. The reliable identification of the pigment compositions was based on coincidence of the {XRF}, {PCA} and the Raman results which confirmed the presence of the chalk, malachite, azurite, red lead, mars red, mars yellow and candle black in the historical paints, except of the carbon-based black pigment being out of the {XRF} detection range. Different hues of the green paint were specified and the variety of the red and brown ones was ascribed to compositions of the Pb- and Fe-based red pigments (Fe2O3 and Pb3O4) with addition of the vermilion ({HgS}) and carbon black, in agreement with literature. The traces of elements: Ba and Sr, Sb and Mo, and also Cd, were ascribed to the impurities of Ca, those of some ochre pigments, and to the soluble Cd salts, respectively.},

It can detect elements having atomic number {\textgreater} 15 (phosphorus) and supplies only semiquatitative results, yet it can be helpful in a very wide range of applications. The {ENEA} Unit for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage has acquired considerable experience in {XRF} analysis, investigating more than 500 works of art including easel and mural paintings, mosaics, glasses, ceramics and bronzes. Using {XRF} analysis sometimes it is possible to detect undocumented pigments or to characterize traditional materials better. This technique of analysis also allows the investigation of impurities of elements having medium or high atomic number, in some cases such impurities can help to establish the provenance of the materials or to characterize differences in the same work due to restoration or to the presence of unoriginal parts. On glass, {XRF} can identify the nature of the colouring substances and opacifiers. A large number of measurements can be collected for statistical processing and comparison, which is very important, in particular, in the case of mosaics, and yields information which may not be evident if only a single measurement is considered.

	abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering ({SERS}) is a powerful technique for the detection of natural dyes found in archeological and historical textiles, in paintings, and in other works of art. Natural organic products historically used as textile dyes or lake pigments are often fluorescent under normal dispersive Raman measurement conditions. To add to the fluorescence problem, the amount of dye actually present on works of art is minimal, requiring extremely sensitive analytical techniques. The enhancement of the Raman signal and the quenching of the background fluorescence resulting from the adsorption of dye molecules on metal nanoparticles in {SERS} concur to solve the problems encountered when studying dyes by Raman spectroscopy. Reproducible spectra of several reference dyes were obtained, and extraction and adsorption protocols to optimize the analysis of samples from actual work of art were developed. {SERS} supports evaluated include citrate-reduced and hydroxylamine-reduced Ag colloids, as well as Tollens mirrors and silver nanoisland films. Dyes for which {SERS} spectra were observed include: alizarin, purpurin, laccaic acid, carminic acid, kermesic acid, shikonin, juglone, lawsone, brazilin and brazilein, haematoxylin and haematein, fisetin, quercitrin, quercetin, rutin, and morin. The incompatibility with {SERS} of techniques traditionally used to extract dyes from artwork samples was demonstrated, and a nonextractive hydrolysis technique specially suited to prepare {SERS} microscopic samples was developed. Finally, {SERS} was successfully used to identify alizarin in a 1mm by 50 {\textmu}m (diameter) single fiber sample form a sixteenth-century tapestry.

New bands in the scattering spectrum of adsorbed pyridine have been characterized, which were not previously reported, as well as the Raman intensity response of all the surface pyridine bands as a function of electrode potential. As a result of these experiments, we have proposed a model of the adsorbed species for pyridine in which the adsorption is anion induced, leading to an axial end-on attachment to the electrode surface. The ability to obtain resonance Raman spectra with good signal-to-noise with laser powers less than 1.0 {mW}, reported here for the first time, opens up possibilities of surface Raman studies with relatively inexpensive laser systems. As laser power requirements are relaxed, reliability is improved, and greater tuning ranges can be achieved for wavelength dependent studies. We previously demonstrated the potential of resonance Raman spectroscopy for monitoring solution kinetic behavior [2], and now have shown that {NR} as well as {RR} spectroscopy has sufficient sensitivity to extend the studies of kinetic processes to include those occurring at electrode surfaces.},

	abstract = {Since the first reported analytical studies and technical examinations of art and archaeological objects conducted in the late 18th century, analytical techniques and methods applied to the study of artworks have constantly grown. Among the materials composing the art object, organic compounds used as binding media or protective coatings have attracted the attention of the conservation profession given their noticeable ability for undergoing morphological and chemical changes on ageing. Thus, the aim of this paper is to review the most recent advances in the identification and determination of organic compounds present in art and art conservation materials. Immunofluorescence techniques have been proposed in recent decades as an alternative to the classical and simpler microchemical tests. Besides, a variety of instrumental techniques have also been improved in an attempt to enhance the sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy of the analytical results. Spectroscopic techniques, such as {UV}{\textendash}vis, {FTIR} and Raman spectroscopy, have been coupled with light microscopes for these purposes. Synchrotron radiation {FTIR} microspectroscopy has also been successfully applied to the analysis of artworks. Mass spectrometry has also been increasingly used as a detector system coupled with a chromatographic device. Chromatographic methods have also improved in recent years. Paper and thin layer chromatographic techniques have been progressively replaced with gas chromatography ({GC}), pyrolysis-{GC}, high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. More complex proteomics hyphenated techniques, such as nano-liquid chromatography{\textendash}nano-electrospray ionisation/collision quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry, have been recently applied to the identification and determination of proteinaceous binders. Microbeam analytical techniques have also been incorporated into the list of advanced instrumental techniques for art conservation purposes. Finally, a number of new instrumental techniques have been proposed as a suitable alternative to the conventional microscopy techniques for morphological studies.},

Moreover, it confirmed the usefulness of this approach to the detailed evaluation of icons in general and provided significant structural data on representative portable icons of Cretan-style religious painting.

By contrast, the rather elementary overpaintings are of low tonality, consisting predominantly of mixtures of minium and carbon black, and also the synthetic pigments ultramarine blue, {\textquotedblleft}chrome green{\textquotedblright} (Prussian blue + lead chromate), chrome yellow and lithopone. A blend of linseed oil and egg provided the binder for the pigments used. The same artist is understood from art historians to have overpainted both icons at the beginning of the 20th century.

The heterogeneous polymeric nature of the pigment, together with its fluorescent background, makes its identification by normal Raman spectroscopy difficult. In the present study, {SERS} and {FTIR} spectra of sepia were obtained. {SERS} proved to be suitable to characterize this complex material in micro-samples because of its sensitivity, ability to quench fluorescence, and minimal preparation required. For the {SERS} measurements, different substrates were tested in contact with the sepia pigment. It was found that a sodium borohydride reduced silver colloid gave the best performance, particularly when applied as a drop on top of a solid sepia sample, and subsequently dried. A larger enhancement was observed in the {SERS} spectrum of the sepia sample extracted in the laboratory, when compared to the more pure commercial sample, consistently with the higher metal binding capacity of less pure sepia melanin reported by other authors. The {FTIR} and {SERS} frequencies observed were found to be consistent with those reported in the literature for closely related compounds, such as indole, pyrrole and substituted pyrroles, and were assigned by comparison with them and with other published data for functional groups in organic chemistry.},

	abstract = {Organic dyes extracted from plants, insects, and shellfish have been used for millennia in dyeing textiles and manufacturing colorants for painting. The economic push for dyes with high tinting strength, directly related to high extinction coefficients in the visible range, historically led to the selection of substances that could be used at low concentrations. But a desirable property for the colorist is a major problem for the analytical chemist; the identification of dyes in cultural heritage objects is extremely difficult. Techniques routinely used in the identification of inorganic pigments are generally not applicable to dyes: X-ray fluorescence because of the lack of an elemental signature, Raman spectroscopy because of the generally intense luminescence of dyes, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy because of the interference of binders and extenders. Traditionally, the identification of dyes has required relatively large samples (0.5?5 mm in diameter) for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography. In this Account, we describe our efforts to develop practical approaches in identifying dyes in works of art from samples as small as 25 ?m in diameter with surface-enhanced Raman scattering ({SERS}). In {SERS}, the Raman scattering signal is greatly enhanced when organic molecules with large delocalized electron systems are adsorbed on atomically rough metallic substrates; fluorescence is concomitantly quenched. Recent nanotechnological advances in preparing and manipulating metallic particles have afforded staggering enhancement factors of up to 1014. {SERS} is thus an ideal technique for the analysis of dyes. Indeed, rhodamine 6G and crystal violet, two organic compounds used to demonstrate the sensitivity of {SERS} at the single-molecule level, were first synthesized as textile dyes in the second half of the 19th century. In this Account, we examine the practical application of {SERS} to cultural heritage studies, including the selection of appropriate substrates, the development of analytical protocols, and the building of {SERS} spectral databases. We also consider theoretical studies on dyes of artistic interest. Using {SERS}, we have successfully documented the earliest use of a madder lake pigment and the earliest occurrence of lac dye in European art. We have also found several examples of kermes and cochineal glazes, as well as madder, cochineal, methyl violet, and eosin lakes, from eras ranging from ancient Egypt to the 19th century. The ability to rapidly analyze very small samples with {SERS} makes it a particularly valuable tool in a museum context.},

	abstract = {The Raman spectra of approximately 20 reference samples of cobalt-based green and violet artists' pigments of various provenance (present day manufactory, historical reference pigments and samples from a contemporary artist's studio) were acquired to assist in the identification of unknown cobalt-based pigments in works by Pablo Picasso (1881{\textendash}1973) and Jasper Johns (b. 1930). Specifically, Raman spectra were obtained for various cobalt titanate greens (Co2TiO4), highlighting variability in peak positions because of ionic substitutions in the spinel structures of such pigments. The Raman spectra of the cobalt violet pigments magnesium cobalt arsenate ({MgxCo}3-x({AsO}4)2) and hydrated forms, ammonium cobalt phosphate hydrate ({NH}4CoPO4*H2O), and anhydrous cobalt phosphate, Co3({PO}4)2 were also recorded; some of which are presented here for the first time. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}), x-ray fluorescence spectrometry ({XRF}) and x-ray diffraction ({XRD}) were employed to confirm the composition of the reference materials. An optimal technique to characterize microscopic cross sections from the studied artworks is Raman microscopy, which can also provide valuable information on the hydration states of the examined phases. The multi-analytical methodology allowed the identification of the unknown green pigment used by Jasper Johns as cobalt titanate green (C.I. {PG} 50); representing the first documented occurrence of this pigment in the palette of a renowned contemporary artist. Both magnesium cobalt arsenate (in anhydrous and hydrated forms) and anhydrous cobalt phosphate were identified in the Picasso painting.This research advances the knowledge of 20th century synthetic inorganic pigments used by artists and documents their usage in actual works of art.

Tools currently available that can detect and identify organic colorants in severely degraded works of art are rare, given the heavy deterioration and restricted availability of the sample. Recently, however, surface-enhanced Raman scattering ({SERS}) spectroscopy has shown great promise in detecting and identifying mass-limited samples. The art conservation field has seized upon the opportunity opened up by this powerful analytical technique to enable the identification of microscopic amounts of organic molecules used as artists' colorants in complex matrices, such as biomaterials (i.e. dyed natural textiles, linseed oil biofilms present in oil paintings, etc.), a possibility that was previously precluded due to interfering fluorescence and small sample size. Here, we report {SERS} spectra recorded directly on single particles of red lake pigments from an important historical watercolor by the American master Winslow Homer (1836{\textendash}1910) that suffered some degree of fading. The accurate colorant identification provided by {SERS}, enhanced by comparison with reference samples of historical watercolors, has thus enabled important discoveries regarding the materials and intended meanings behind artworks from one of the most influential American watercolor painters.

	abstract = {The industrial application of paints today involves the handling of millions of tons of pigment dispersions. Shear and mechanical stress during pumping, storage, or processing significantly affect color and shelf life. Currently, mainly empirical test series and pilot-scale process models are used to assess the stability of such dispersions and provide marginal guidance when developing or testing large-scale paint applications. Scaling the stability against shear stress is particularly important for water-based metal pigment dispersions where damage to the pigment flakes causes their deterioration. The present work investigates the scaling of shear stress from the production line ({\textgreater}1000 tons/yr) to laboratory scale (100-g scale). We analytically show why the integrated shear stress on a specific dispersion can be deconvoluted into a series of individual shear stress contributions. These individual contributions can be accurately reproduced in the laboratory using a Couette-type shearing setup similar to a classical rheometer. As a representative example, a stable and a shear-sensitive paint from an automotive production line was sampled over 4 months of production. The evolving deterioration, color changes, and dispersion instability could be accurately reproduced using the scaling method outlined here.},

	abstract = {The effects of rubber particle size and rubber-matrix adhesion on notched impact toughness of nylon-rubber blends are analysed. A sharp tough-brittle transition is found to occur at a critical particle size, when the rubber volume fraction and rubber-matrix adhesion are held constant. The critical particle size increases with increasing rubber volume fraction, given by dc = Tc\{($\pi$6$\Phi$r)13 - 1\}-1, dc is the critical particle diameter, Tc the critical interparticle distance, and {\o}r the rubber volume fraction. The critical interparticle distance is a material property of the matrix, independent of rubber volume fraction and particle size. Thus, the general condition for toughening is that the interparticle distance must be smaller than the critical value. Van der Waals attraction gives sufficient adhesion for toughening. Interfacial chemical bonding is not necessary. Even if there is interfacial chemical bonding, a polymer-rubber blend will still be brittle, if the interparticle distance is greater than the critical value. The minimum adhesion required is about 1000 J m-2, typical for van der Waals adhesion. In contrast, chemical adhesion is typically 8000 J m-2. The present criterion for toughening is proposed to be valid for all polymer{\textemdash}rubber blends which dissipate the impact energy mainly by increased matrix yielding.},

Criteria are presented which oligonucleotide sequences must fulfill in order to yield these junction structures. The generable junctions are nexi, from which 3 to 8 double helices may emanate. Each junction may be treated as a macromolecular {\textquotedblleft}valence cluster{\textquotedblright}, and the individual clusters may be linked together directly, or with pieces of linear {DNA} interspersed between them. This covalent linkage can be done with enormous specificity, using the sticky-ended ligation techniques currently employed in genetic engineering studies.

The Cypriot collection housed in the Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne was used as a case study for identifying adhesive samples. An initial survey of the collection determined which items have been repaired with an adhesive and estimated the level of difficulty that would be involved with removing a sample. Next a polymer resin identification survey was conducted on all items, which had adhesive repairs. Instead of removing artifacts from their museum storage area, which pose the risk of breakage, a portable {FTIR} unit was brought into the storage space where the collection is housed. Analysis involved micro-sampling using water/acetone swabs (or physical removal if the polymer film was insoluble), immediate data collection, analysis and identification based on reference spectra of commercial adhesive products anecdotally known to be used for repairing archaeological pottery. As a consequence of sample collection and the assessment of spectral data quality being conducted concurrently, most adhesive samples were successfully identified. Subsequent analysis allowed comparisons to be made between the adhesive types identified, adhesive appearance and the original archaeological dig sites. In addition an assessment was made of adhesive performance.},

Recently, however, research has established strong evidence supporting the theory that the distinct surface patterns on these blades result from a carbide-banding phenomenon produced by the microsegregation of minor amounts of carbide-forming elements present in the wootz ingots from which the blades were forged. Further, it is likely that wootz Damascus blades with damascene patterns may have been produced only from wootz ingots supplied from those regions of India having appropriate impurity-containing ore deposits.},

Calculations of carbonate saturation states currently require measurements of two {CO}2 system parameters, such as {pH} and total dissolved carbon, plus thermodynamic calculations that relate carbonate ion concentrations to directly measured parameters. In this work we report novel procedures for direct measurements of carbonate ion concentrations and saturation states in seawater. Measurements are obtained via ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of Pb({II}) spectra as the relative concentrations of {PbCO}30 and an ensemble of lead chloride complexes vary in response to dissolved {CO}32-. Measurement precision is enhanced by parameterization in terms of absorbance ratios. The {PbCO}30 stability constant, and Pb({II}) molar absorbance ratios in seawater, were determined at 25~{\textdegree}C over a range of salinity between 36 and 20. The procedures described in this work are well suited to measurements throughout the normal range of carbonate ion concentrations in the oceans. Rapid equilibration rates for Pb({II}) carbonate complexation make the procedures described in this work well suited to rapid direct analysis in situ.},

They provide a broad range of technical applications such as soldering in automotive processing, microelectromechanical systems ({MEMS}) and solar panels. Due to the fascinating variety of microstructural changes solder materials underlie, their micromorphological dynamics have been extensively studied in the past decades by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. The evolved microstructure exerts a significant effect, in particular, in very small components such as solder joints in microelectronic packages. In order to capture the essence of the microstructural evolution in solder alloys with a diffusion theory of heterogeneous solid mixtures we employ an extended Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard phase-field model. In our contribution we introduce different numerical schemes to treat Cahn{\textendash}Hilliard equation. Here we focus on the innovative isogeometric finite element approach and outline its considerable benefits in comparison to the other methods. To this end we present numerical simulations of phase decomposition and coarsening controlled by diffusion for eutectic binary solders Sn{\textendash}Pb and Ag{\textendash}Cu illustrating the versatility of this approach. A concluding computational study of a three-dimensional phase separation event within a solder ball geometry will corroborate the quality of our model.},

	abstract = {Isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation kinetics have been measured dilatometrically for the $\gamma$ {\textrightarrow} $\alpha$ + $\gamma$' and $\gamma$' {\textrightarrow} P reactions in a 1025 steel. The isothermal transformation of austenite for each reaction was found to fit the Avrami equation after the fraction transformed was normalized to unity at the completion of the reaction and a transformation-start time was determined. The transformation kinetics under isothermal conditions therefore were characterized in terms of the n and b parameters from the Avrami equation together with the transformation-start times. The parameter n was found to be independent of temperature over the range studied (645 to 760 {\textdaggerdbl}C) and to have values of 0.99 and 1.33 for the ferrite and pearlite reactions, respectively. This indicates that the nucleation condition is essentially constant and site saturation occurs early in the transformation process. The continuous-cooling experiments were conducted at cooling rates of 2 to 150 {\textdaggerdbl}C per second to determine the transformation-start times for the ferrite and pearlite reactions and the completion time for transformation to pearlite under {CCT} conditions. Both reactions were found to obey the Additivity Principle for continuous cooling provided that the incubation (pre-transformation) period was not included in the transformation time. The isothermal transformation data and {CCT} transformation-start times have been incorporated in a mathematical model to predict continuous-cooling transformation kinetics that agree closely with measurements made at three cooling rates.},

The geometrical model of the {ACL} was built from experimental measurements performed on a cadaveric knee specimen which was also subjected to kinematics tests. These experiments were used to enforce the particular boundary conditions used in the numerical model. A previously developed transversely isotropic hyperelastic material model was implemented and the ability to pre-stress the ligament was also included. The model exhibited the key characteristics of connective soft tissues: anisotropy, nonlinear behaviour, large strains, very high compliance for compressive or bending loading along the collagen fibres and incompressibility. Simulations of passive knee flexion were performed, with and without pre-stressing the {ACL}. The resultant force generated by the {ACL} was monitored and the results compared to existing experimental data. The stress distribution within the ligament was also assessed. When the {ACL} was pre-stressed, there was a good correlation between the predicted and experimental resultant forces reported in the literature over the entire flexion{\textendash}extension range. The stress distribution in the pre-stressed and stress-free {ACL} were similar, although the magnitudes in the pre-stressed {ACL} were higher, particularly at low flexion angles.},

	abstract = {Solar cells are attractive candidates for clean and renewable power1, 2; with miniaturization, they might also serve as integrated power sources for nanoelectronic systems. The use of nanostructures or nanostructured materials represents a general approach to reduce both cost and size and to improve efficiency in photovoltaics1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires have been used to improve charge collection efficiency in polymer-blend4 and dye-sensitized solar cells5, 6, to demonstrate carrier multiplication7, and to enable low-temperature processing of photovoltaic devices3, 4, 5, 6. Moreover, recent theoretical studies have indicated that coaxial nanowire structures could improve carrier collection and overall efficiency with respect to single-crystal bulk semiconductors of the same materials8, 9. However, solar cells based on hybrid nanoarchitectures suffer from relatively low efficiencies and poor stabilities1. In addition, previous studies have not yet addressed their use as photovoltaic power elements in nanoelectronics. Here we report the realization of p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) coaxial silicon nanowire solar cells. Under one solar equivalent (1-sun) illumination, the p-i-n silicon nanowire elements yield a maximum power output of up to 200 {pW} per nanowire device and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of up to 3.4 per cent, with stable and improved efficiencies achievable at high-flux illuminations. Furthermore, we show that individual and interconnected silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements can serve as robust power sources to drive functional nanoelectronic sensors and logic gates. These coaxial silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements provide a new nanoscale test bed for studies of photoinduced energy/charge transport and artificial photosynthesis10, and might find general usage as elements for powering ultralow-power electronics11 and diverse nanosystems12, 13.},

Upon heating the granular structure vanishes. Observations support the view recently established by {SAXS} experiments that polymer crystallization is a two-step process, with the block formation near the growth front as a first and their fusion into a lamella as a second step. It is proposed that the blocks have the minimum size necessary to remain intrinsically stable. This could explain the observed invariability of the crystal thickness with changing co-unit content.},

	abstract = {In this paper the dynamic mechanical behaviour of ultra-high modulus polyethylene is reported. The results are discussed in terms of a fibre reinforced composite model, in which the amount of fibre phase is related to the number of intercrystalline bridges determined from X-ray diffraction data. For both drawn and extruded materials a good correlation has been obtained between the plateau modulus at -50{\textdegree}C and the longitudinal crystal thickness. This correlation is given a quantitative interpretation in terms of the model and the increase in modulus with increasing deformation ratio is ascribed to an increase in continuity of the crystalline phase. The increase in tensile modulus on cooling through the $\gamma$-process is related primarily to the change in the tensile modulus of the amorphous phase. The fall in modulus at high temperature, on the other hand, indicates a fall in the shear modulus of the crystalline phase, which provides a satisfactory explanation of the $\alpha$-process.},

	abstract = {Elastomeric networks were prepared from a sample of polyisobutylene having 2 mol\% isoprene units as unsaturated sites for free-radical crosslinking. Four samples having different degrees of crosslinking were obtained by peroxide thermolysis, and were then studied with regard to their thermoelastic properties in elongation. Each network strip was elongated at 338 K to ensure that it was completely amorphous, and then held at this constant length. The temperature was then slowly decreased at intervals, and the equilibrium value of the elastic force recorded for each temperature. The temperatures at which crystallization was observed from changes in the stress-temperature dependence were taken to be approximate melting points. The temperature range over which crystallization occurred was found to narrow considerably with increase in elongation. It was found that at lower elongations, the nominal melting points increased gradually with increase in elongation, while at higher elongations, their dependence on elongation became linear and more pronounced. The dependence of the melting points on the molecular weights between crosslinks and on strain were documented, and then compared with relevant theory. For each degree of crosslinking, estimated degrees of crystallinity were found to increase substantially and linearly with increase in elongation.},

The use of membrane desalination has increased as materials have improved and costs have decreased. Today, reverse osmosis membranes are the leading technology for new desalination installations, and they are applied to a variety of salt water resources using tailored pretreatment and membrane system design. Two distinct branches of reverse osmosis desalination have emerged: seawater reverse osmosis and brackish water reverse osmosis. Differences between the two water sources, including foulants, salinity, waste brine (concentrate) disposal options, and plant location, have created significant differences in process development, implementation, and key technical problems. Pretreatment options are similar for both types of reverse osmosis and depend on the specific components of the water source. Both brackish water and seawater reverse osmosis ({RO}) will continue to be used worldwide; new technology in energy recovery and renewable energy, as well as innovative plant design, will allow greater use of desalination for inland and rural communities, while providing more affordable water for large coastal cities. A wide variety of research and general information on {RO} desalination is available; however, a direct comparison of seawater and brackish water {RO} systems is necessary to highlight similarities and differences in process development. This article brings to light key parameters of an {RO} process and process modifications due to feed water characteristics.},

Both the lengthening rates and thickening rates were found to be orders of magnitude too rapid to be controlled by the volume diffusion of Cu toward the growing allotrimorphs. Analyses of these kinetic data indicate that the thickening of $\theta$ allotriomorphs is controlled by the rate of diffusion of Cu along the $\alpha$ : $\theta$ boundary comprising the broad faces of the allotriomorphs. The lengthening of these crystals proceeds by volume diffusion of Cu to the $\alpha$:$\alpha$ grain boundaries, followed by grain boundary diffusion to the advancing edges of the allotriomorphs. From the thickening kinetics, the interphase boundary diffusion coefficient was found to be D$\alpha$$\theta$ = 0.23 exp (-12,800/{RT}), in order of magnitude agreement with diffusivities along disordered grain boundaries in other metals.},

Small crystallites of {MgO} were distributed singly and in clusters along Al-{SiC} interfaces in all specimens. Interfacial segregation and precipitation involving alloy species apparently affected precipitation in the matrix, where the distribution of phases was found to be very heterogeneous. Matrix phases also included unusually large constituent particles and dispersoids, a consequence of the composite processing methods. The relationship between the observed microstructure and the composite mechanical behavior reported by others is discussed. The heterogeneous distribution of matrix phases is expected to result in a wide variation in local yield stress and local work-hardening rate within the composite.},

	abstract = {Rate laws are derived for transformations in which the new phase nucleates on grain boundary surface, grain edges, or grain corners, and in which the new phase grows with constant radial velocity. Time-dependent and time-independent nucleation rates are treated. At high nucleation rates (relative to growth rates and grain sizes) the rate law assumes a form independent of the nucleation rate, and the half-time of the transformation becomes approximately 0.1 {DG}, where D is the grain diameter and G the radial growth velocity, independently of which sites are responsible for nucleation. At low nucleation rates the rate law approaches that given by randomly distributed nucleation sites. The conditions which determine which type of site will produce the most nuclei, and hence determine the form of the rate law, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The problems of osteolysis and late aseptic loosening associated with ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene ({UHMWPE}) particles has lead to a renewed interest in metal-on-metal prostheses. Wear particles generated by modern Co-Cr-on-Co-Cr prostheses are nanometre in size (range: 10-120 nm; mean: about 40 nm), an order of magnitude smaller than the size of {UHMWPE} known to be critical for activation of osteolytic cytokines by macrophages. Co-Cr wear particles will induce osteolytic cytokine production by human macrophages, but only at high volumetric concentrations. Unlike {UHMWPE}, Co-Cr particles are not inert. Co-Cr particles have the potential to release metal ions; they may be toxic to cells, induce deoxyribonucleic acid damage or cause host hypersensitivity The nanometre size range of Co-Cr wear particles means that they may be disseminated widely in the body. The potential for metal-on-metal bearings to induce adverse effects clinically will be dependent upon the rate of wear. What constitutes a safe wear rate for modern metal-on-metal bearings is unknown. However, the wear of metal-on-metal prostheses is critically dependent upon the design and, in particular, the carbon content of the alloy, the radial clearance, and the head diameter. Thus, the potential for adverse biological reactions associated with metal-on-metal bearings can be reduced by selection of appropriately designed implants.},

	abstract = {A new interpretation of the habits of ice growing from vapour is proposed. The basic habits of ice alternate three times: plates (A) {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} -4{\^A}{\textdegree}C {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} columns (B) {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} -10{\^A}{\textdegree}C {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} plates (C) {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} between -20{\^A}{\textdegree}C and -35{\^A}{\textdegree}C {\^a}{\textdagger}{\textquoteright} columns (D). The theory is based on a view- that the surface of ice just below 0{\^A}{\textdegree}C is covered with a quasi-liquid layer, whose thickness {\"I}{\textquoteleft} or coverage {\^I}{\textasciiacute} decreases with falling temperature, and therefore the growth mechanism of a crystal face changes also as follows: (I) Vapour{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}Quasi-Liquid{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright} Solid mechanism ({\^I}{\textasciiacute} \&gt; 1), ({II}) Adhesive Growth on a surface strongly adsorbed by H2O molecules (0.02 \&lt; {\^I}{\textasciiacute} \&lt; 1) and ({III}) Two- Dimensional Nucleation Growth on a surface with low eigen adsorption ({\^I}{\textasciiacute} \&lt; 0.02). The type of surface structure and consequently the growth mechanism depends on the surface orientation and the temperature. The complicated habit change is caused mainly by the combination of surface kinetics of the \{0001\} and \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} face. The first and second conversion temperature ({TAB}, {TBC}) are expected to be independent of the absolute supersaturation {\^I}{\textasciiacute}P as found in experiments. On the other hand, the third ({TCD}) is the temperature where the usual two-dimensional nucleation growth rate of the \{0001\} face reaches the one of the \{1010\} face, and exceeds it by the effect of diffusion field, so that the third conversion temperature falls with decreasing {\^I}{\textasciiacute}P. The marked columnar crystals observed at -7{\^A}{\textdegree}C can be explained only by taking into account the spherical volume diffusion field near the \{0001\} face and a cylindrical one near the \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} face. For plate-like crystals between -10{\^A}{\textdegree}C and -20{\^A}{\textdegree}C to -35{\^A}{\textdegree}C the surface diffusion from \{0001\} to \{1010\} and volume diffision with cylindrical symmetry near \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} faces is very important.},

By measuring the frequency and dissipation at the fundamental resonant frequency (5 {MHz}) and at the third harmonic (15 {MHz}), we obtain three independent quantities. For coatings with a predominantly elastic response, characterized by relatively low phase angles, these quantities are the mass per unit area of the coating, the density-shear modulus product, and the phase angle itself. The approach was demonstrated with a model polyurethane coating, where the evolution of these properties as a function of cure time was investigated. For fully cured films, data obtained from the {QCM} are in good agreement with results obtained from traditional dynamic mechanical analysis.},

The technique is increasingly being used to investigate the mechanical response of molecular structures that form at these interfaces as well, utilizing analysis techniques developed by the solid mechanics community. The aim of this highlight is to summarize the formal analysis methods needed to analyze these types of experiments and to make the connection between liquid-like behavior of the interface, and the more general solid-like case where the two principal interfacial tensions are not necessarily equal to one another. Several illustrative examples are used to accomplish this, including protein complexes formed at the oil{\textendash}water interface, ionically crosslinked block copolymer monolayers at oil{\textendash}water interfaces, and block copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers at the air{\textendash}water interface. In addition to describing the mechanical analysis of these types of experiments, we provide a stability map that defines the experimental window within which useful pendant drop experiments can be conducted for interfacial layers with liquid-like behavior.},

Softening was believed to result from the shear-induced formation of highly localized regions of deformation in the macromolecular network. This behavior was accurately captured by a model that incorporated the strain energy and relaxation behavior of individual network strands in the solution. Flow curves predicted from the model were nonmonotonic, consistent with the onset of flow instabilities at high shear rates. The nonlinear stress response reported here, coupled with the wide range of accessible relaxation times of these thermoreversible solutions, makes them ideal model systems for studies of failure-mode transitions in physically associating solutions and gels.},

A model is proposed for the explanation of this phenomenon. We suggest that the interplay of the liquid-solid interfacial energy with the silicon surface energy expressed in terms of an edge tension is responsible for the change of the growth direction. The value of the edge tension is estimated by the product of the interfacial thickness with the surface energy of silicon. For large diameters, the direction with the lowest interfacial energy is dominant, whereas for small diameters the surface energy of the silicon nanowire determines the preferential growth direction.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic formalism with the [Omega] potential is applied for finding the conditions of mechanical equilibrium (Laplace's law and Young's equation) in the case of small liquid droplets attached at a plane surface. The conditions of stability of the equilibrium drops are examined. It is shown that at positive values of the line tension of the contact perimeter there exists a supersaturation above which no heterogeneous nucleation occurs. Below this maximum value of the supersaturation two equilibrium cap-shaped drops could coexist. They are both in unstable equilibrium with their surroundings. No range of supersaturations exists where the smaller equilibrium drop would be in stable equilibrium with the surroundings. Such a conclusion has been proposed (V.C. Noninski, Colloids Surfaces, 42 (1989) 205; J. Colloid Interface Sci., 143 (1991) 374) on the basis of the incorrect assumption that the stability of the equilibrium could be referred to the slope of the Thomson--Gibbs dependence of vapour pressure on drop size. Positive slopes of this dependence imply stability equilibrium in the case of free drops only. For the case of cap-shaped drops where the [Omega] potential is a function of two (or more) geometrical variables, the determination of the stability conditions follows another procedure shown in the present paper.},

	abstract = {Free energy minimization may seem like an universally valid method to single out the thermodynamic equilibrium states among a certain set of imaginable system states. Nevertheless, especially for capillary systems, it happens that false minima arise in the free energy functions chosen which are incompatible with the Young contact angle condition. In the present paper we elucidate this question for the case of a gas bubble submerged in water and adhering to a planar hydrophobic wall at constant chemical potentials. In particular, it is shown that by assuming a priori the Laplace condition, one finds a mechanically unstable (i.e. false) minimum of geometric origin when the contact angle [theta] is equal to 90{\textdegree}, and, in addition, a (correct) maximum at some angle [theta]{\textgreater}90{\textdegree} where the Young condition is fulfilled. On the other hand, still assuming a spherical bubble shape but considering the [Omega]-potential of the contact angle system to be a function of two geometric variables (bubble radius, r and height, h, instead of just h), only one extremum is obtained: The maximum arising for an angle [theta]{\textgreater}90{\textdegree}. Physically, our analysis implies that stable attachment of a small gas bubble to an ideal, molecularly smooth, hydrophobic solid surface at constant chemical potentials will not occur.},

Structure and property changes resulted almost independent of the different treatments and were followed by Fourier transform infrared analysis ({FTIR}), thermogravimetry ({TG}), differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}), insoluble determination and size exclusion chromatography ({SEC}). The initial phase of drying consists of the autoxidation phenomenon of the unsaturated fatty acid components with the development of extensive cross-linking, together with formation of conjugated unsaturations. The following stage of slow consumption of labile cross-links gives rise to a highly stable network, which contains small amounts of low molecular weight molecules, either formed by fragmentation or still present as unreacted triglycerides. The oxidative degradation of linseed oil consists of the continuation of the hardening process, and only for long periods of artificial ageing, corresponding to years of natural ageing, the oxidation also takes place on the alkylic segments, leading to partial fragmentation of the structure.},

Totally noninvasive methods of analysis were used, including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, visible reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction; moreover, the feasibility of using a portable Raman spectrometer for the in-field identification of jades has been demonstrated. Fe/Fe+Mg (\% p.f.u.) ratios of the jades have been calculated based on hydroxyl stretching Raman bands, which will provide an important addition to similar data that are being collected at major museums in the Western and Eastern hemispheres.

Physically associating synthetic polymer networks can be an exception to this rule and can demonstrate strain-stiffening behavior at relatively low values of strain. Here, the stiffening behavior of model elastic networks of physically associating triblock copolymers is characterized by shear rheometry. Experiments demonstrate a clear correlation between network structure and strain-stiffening behavior. Stiffening is accurately captured by a constitutive model with a single fitting parameter related to the midblock length. The same model is also effective for describing the stiffening of actin, collagen, and other biopolymer networks. Our synthetic polymer networks could be useful model systems for biological materials due to (1) the observed similarity in strain-stiffening behavior, which can be quantified and related to network structure, and (2) the tunable structure of the physically associating network, which can be manipulated to yield a desired response.},

It was found that incubation time and concentration of {HA} used had an effect on the area modulus and water permeability of the membranes. These factors also affected the kinetics of membrane growth as evidenced in {SEM} micrographs, which showed differences in the structure. Area modulus of membranes changed from about 6 N m-1  for the lower weight percent {HA} system at the shortest incubation time of 3 minutes, up to 12 N m-1 for the higher weight percent {HA} system at the longest incubation time of 60 minutes. Water permeability decreased with incubation time, but the lower weight percent {HA} system showed a lower water permeability when compared to the higher weight percent {HA} system at the same incubation time.

	abstract = {Gradient copolymers are prepared from comonomer systems with a range of segregation strengths and homopolymer glass transition temperature (Tg) differences to explore the breadths that can be achieved by their single, continuous glass transition regions compared to random and block copolymers. A variety of chain architectures are synthesized using semibatch nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymerization, including linear gradients, sigmoidal gradients, blocky gradients, and blocky random cases. The derivative of the differential scanning calorimetry heat curve is used to extract Tg breadths ($\Delta$Tgs). For the first time, these Tg breadths are compared against values derived from nanophase separation levels predicted by self-consistent mean-field theory and found to be in good accord. In moderately segregating systems (styrene (S)/n-butyl acrylate and S/tert-butyl acrylate), $\Delta$Tg may be tuned dramatically via gradient structure and molecular weight; e.g., a Tg breadth exceeding 100 {\textdegree}C, or {\textgreater}65\% of the homopolymer Tg difference, is obtained with a sigmoidal gradient copolymer of S/n-butyl acrylate. In the very weakly segregating system (S/n-butyl methacrylate), $\Delta$Tg remains narrow ({\textless}40\% of the homopolymer Tg difference), regardless of gradient design. In strongly segregating systems (S/4-vinylpyridine and S/4-acetoxystyrene ({AS})), $\Delta$Tgs are observed spanning 70-80\% of the homopolymer Tg difference. Small-angle X-ray scattering applied to S/{AS} materials demonstrates a range of temperature-sensitive scattering intensities consistent with the level of segregation observed through their $\Delta$Tgs.},

We show that the sequence of morphological transitions at low mismatch strain is qualitatively identical to that for pure Ge heteroepitaxy on Si(001). In particular, films with strains less than 1\% undergo Stranski-Krastanov-like island-on-layer growth, followed by an extended regime of [501]-faceted hut clusters that eventually transform into higher aspect ratio dome clusters. The hut and dome islands are fully coherently strained and do not exhibit lateral composition modulation. Quantitatively, the relevant island length scales are significantly increased at low strain. Scaling of the morphological transitions with strain is directly demonstrated using the real time stress data. We further show that the apparent formation of a ripplelike surface morphology at low strain is actually a consequence of kinetic limitations on adatom diffusion, and does not necessarily signify the presence of a surface instability.},

	abstract = {The growth of self organized fully strained Ge dots is accomplished by using a two step process which consists of depositing Ge dots on a periodic unidirectional undulated Si1-{xGex} (118) template layer. The main reason for this methodology is to make use of the stress driven step bunching that develops on a (118) surface (10? off (001)). In this report we concentrate on the growth mechanism of Ge on the Si1-{xGex} template layer. {RHEED} and {TEM} measurements were used to determine the 2D-3D growth transition as a function of Ge coverage. We find that the onset of the 3D island formation changes from 4 to 7 {ML} on the (001) and (118) surfaces, respectively. While 3D islands are mainly isotropic on Si (001) they elongate along the step edge direction on misoriented surfaces with a reduction of their lateral size in one direction. {AFM} measurements are presented which show the wire shaped Ge islands on the top of the Si1-{xGex} (118) template undulation with improved size homogeneity. The correlation-length of the undulation is mainly controlled by the Ge content of the Si1-{xGex} layer, for example 20 nm large islands are grown on the top of Si0.6Ge0.4(118). Low temperature photoluminescence spectra are also described which show the evolution of features associated with the Si1-{xGex} template layer for Ge coverage between 1 and 6 {ML}. Dramatic changes of the photoluminescence spectra were found for a Ge coverage of 7 {ML}, the dominant band seen for that coverage is shown to be related to 3D island formation. The influence of the growth conditions on the {PL} results is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the analogy with Reynolds{\textquoteright}s theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. These include: (a) films with constant interfacial shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c) films with van der Waals (long-range molecular) forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial dependence of the base-state solution are then studied. These include the examples of nonuniform temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries. Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution equations are considered next. Those include (a) the dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films. The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving contact lines, including effects of heat and mass transport and van der Waals attractions, are then addressed. Several related topics such as falling films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly discussed. The results discussed give motivation for the development of careful experiments which can be used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

	abstract = {Stress in a thin film on a flexible substrate induces a curvature of the substrate. Usually the substrate is orders of magnitude thicker than the film, leading to small and purely elastic deformation of the substrate. In this case, the Stoney equation yields the stress in the film from the measured curvature of the substrate. The Stoney equation contains thickness of film and substrate and the elastic properties of the substrate. Typically the elastic properties of the substrate are specified by E (Young's modulus), and $\nu$ (Poisson's ratio). E and $\nu$ provide a valid description for elastically isotropic substrates, e.g. polycrystalline steel strips, as used by Stoney in 1909. Today the Stoney equation is still used for relating substrate curvature to film stress. However, in the majority of thin film stress measurements by means of substrate curvature, Si wafers are used as the substrate. Silicon wafers are cut from single crystals and are thereby elastically anisotropic. In the present paper, a modified form of the Stoney equation, well known for elastic isotropic substrates, is derived for Si(001) and Si(111) wafers, using the elastic stiffness constants of silicon, cij, instead of the orientation averaged values E and $\nu$, which do not have a meaning for elastically anisotropic single crystal materials. Curvature measurements of thin films on Si(001) and Si(111) wafers are presented. The difference in film-stress-induced curvature of Si(001) and Si(111) wafers is discussed.

It is quite a marvel that nature produces hard and tough materials out of protein as soft as human skin and mineral as brittle as classroom chalk. What are the secrets of nature? Can we learn from this to produce bio-inspired materials in the laboratory? These questions have motivated us to investigate the mechanics of protein{\textendash}mineral nanocomposite structure. Large aspect ratios and a staggered alignment of mineral platelets are found to be the key factors contributing to the large stiffness of biomaterials. A tension{\textendash}shear chain ({TSC}) model of biological nanostructure reveals that the strength of biomaterials hinges upon optimizing the tensile strength of the mineral crystals. As the size of the mineral crystals is reduced to nanoscale, they become insensitive to flaws with strength approaching the theoretical strength of atomic bonds. The optimized tensile strength of mineral crystals thus allows a large amount of fracture energy to be dissipated in protein via shear deformation and consequently enhances the fracture toughness of biocomposites. We derive viscoelastic properties of the protein{\textendash}mineral nanostructure and show that the toughness of biocomposite can be further enhanced by the viscoelastic properties of protein.

The organisational motifs in aqueous gels are dominated primarily by lipophilic interactions while those in organic solvents are formed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Most of the gels are thermoreversible and stable for many months. However, 2?a forms unstable gels with organic solvents which upon ageing transform into variety of crystalline shapes. For some 1?a/alcohol gels, a linear correlation between alcohol dielectric constants (\&epsiv;) and gel melting temperatures (Tg) was found. The 1H {NMR} and {FTIR} spectroscopic investigations of selected gels reveal the existence of temperature dependent network assembly/dissolution equilibrium. In the 1H {NMR} spectra of gels only the molecules dissolved in entrapped solvent could be observed. By using an internal standard, the concentration of dissolved gelator molecules could be determined. In {FTIR} spectra, the bands corresponding to network assembled and dissolved gelator molecules are simultaneously present. This enabled determination of the Kgel values by using both methods. From the plots of ln?Kgel versus 1/T, the {DeltaHgel} values of selected gels have been determined (-{DeltaHgel} in 10-36 {kJ}?mol-1 range) and found to be strongly solvent dependent. The {DeltaHgel} values determined by 1H {NMR} and {FTIR} spectroscopy are in excellent agreement. Crystal structures of 2?a and rac-5?a show the presence of organisational motifs and intermolecular interactions in agreement with those in gel fibres elucidated by spectroscopic methods.},

The paper then looks at the approach of a device maker faced with problems caused by impurities, inclusions, dislocations, and other nonideal properties of real crystals. This question leads to a specification of the crystals suitable for device use. The major parameter of this specification is the infrared Q, which must exceed about 1.8 million for satisfactory performance and yield.

	abstract = {Cadherins are multidomain adhesion proteins whose interactions direct cell sorting during histogenesis. They determine cell adhesion specificity, but prior studies failed to identify physical differences that could underlie cell sorting. These single molecule studies identify kinetic and strength differences between different cadherins. They further demonstrate that the modular extracellular architecture of cleavage stage C-cadherin supports a multistate binding mechanism. These multiple bonds exhibit a kinetic hierarchy of strengths that map to the different cadherin domains. The outer two N-terminal domains of C-cadherin form two bound states with dissociation rates of 3.9 and 0.02 s-1. The latter is 25-fold slower than between the corresponding epithelial cadherin segments. In addition to the two fast bonds, the five-domain fragment ({CEC}1-5) forms two additional stronger, longer-lived bonds with dissociation rates of 0.00039 and 0.00001 s-1. We further quantified the lifetimes of bonds subject to a constant force, and thus identified multiple dissociation events with rates that agree quantitatively with the force spectroscopy data. The qualitative features are similar to those reported for epithelial cadherin. However, the significant differences in the dissociation rates of the outer domains, which include the specificity-determining region, suggest that kinetic differences may determine cadherin discrimination, rather than adhesion energies.},

The hydroxyl-terminated amphiphiles eliminate nonspecific adsorption of the streptavidin to the interface, while streptavidin binds irreversibly to the biotin-terminated molecules. Molecular interactions within this bound layer were studied by measuring changes in the interfacial pressure as the layer is contracted and expanded by changing the volume of the chloroform droplet. A picture of the interfacial structure was obtained from quantitative comparisons between the experimental results and a molecular theory of protein binding to tethered ligands.

Effects of endblock length, endblock fraction, and gel concentration on the gel properties were investigated. A dramatic decrease in {SAXS} intensity was observed over a 20 C interval where the gel transitions smoothly from elastic to viscous behavior. {SAXS} patterns were fit with a Percus-Yevick disordered hard-sphere model from which aggregation number and average domain spacing were calculated. Aggregation number increases with increasing gel concentration and endblock length. Increasing the endblock length from 9K to 25K increases the relaxation time of a gel with a polymer volume fraction of 0.15 by a factor of 106. For a given triblock endblock fraction and molecular weight, the micelle aggregation number is strongly correlated to the gel relaxation time. Arrhenius behavior with an effective activation energy of {\textasciitilde}550 {kJ}/mol was observed for all triblocks and concentrations. This very high effective energy barrier describes gels relaxation behavior over a 40 C temperature range, where the relaxation times vary by a factor of 1010.},

	abstract = {Nitroxide-mediated controlled radical polymerization is used to synthesize gradient and block copolymers of styrene ( S) and 4-acetoxystyrene ( {AS}), and conventional free radical polymerization is used to synthesize S/{AS} random copolymers. The S/{AS} copolymers are hydrolyzed to yield S/4-hydroxystyrene ({HS}) copolymers. Gel permeation chromatography and H-1 {NMR} of aliquots taken during polymerization yield proof of the controlled nature of the gradient copolymer structures. The glass transition temperature (T-g) responses are compared using the derivative of differential scanning calorimetry heat curves, with the temperature range over which the derivative exceeds a base level being equated to the T-g breadth. A single, narrow T-g is obtained in each random copolymer, consistent with a single phase of limited compositional nanoheterogeneity. Two narrow T(g)s are evident in each block copolymer, consistent with well-developed nanophases containing nearly pure S or nearly pure {AS} or {HS} units with a very narrow interphase yielding no indication of an intermediate Tg. In contrast, T-g breadths of similar to 65-80 degrees C are observed in many S/{HS} gradient copolymers, consistent with ordered nanostructures in which the unit cell composition varies sinusoidally. The possibility of capitalizing on the broad T-g of gradient copolymers in damping applications is discussed.},

The film consisted of a layer of acrylic diblock copolymer micelles that was spun-cast onto a silicone elastomer from a suspension in butanol. A circular portion of the layer was transferred to a hemispherical glass indenter with which it was brought into contact. Transfer of the film during tensile loading of the indenter began with nucleation of a cavity at the film/elastomer interface, and was followed by delamination of the film at this interface. Statistical variations in cavity nucleation for identical loading conditions were quantified by defining a Weibull modulus similar to that used to describe the failure of brittle materials. The average energy release rate required for cavity nucleation at a fixed induction time increased with film thickness in a way that is consistent with the existence of a critical value of the hydrostatic tension at the film/substrate interface. This critical hydrostatic tension was comparable in magnitude to the elastic modulus of the substrate, and was about ten times the elastic modulus of the thin film.},

	abstract = {We study the growth and failure of small crack-like defects in elastomers under hydrostatic tension. Since the elastic modulus of elastomers are typically very small in comparison with the cohesive strength, crack-like defects can grow into spherical-like cavities before failure. The condition of crack growth or cavity failure is determined using Griffith's fracture criterion, that is, failure of the cavity or crack growth occurs when the energy release rate of the crack-like defect exceeds the surface energy. Three different material behaviors are considered. In the first, we use a power law material model where the strain energy density function w is {\textbackslash}displaystylew={\textbackslash}fracmgr2nbeta([1+beta(I 1{\textendash}3)]n{\textendash}1), where I 1 is the sum of squares of the principal stretches, mgr is the infinitesimal shear modulus, beta and nne0 are material constants. In the second case, we consider a Mooney-Rivlin material, which describes the deformation of pressure sensitive adhesives. In the final case, we consider a material model proposed by Gent (1996), which takes into account the condition that a molecular network will fail at some critical stretch ratio. The dependence of the energy release rate on the applied hydrostatic tension is determined using a large strain finite element method. Comparisons are made between our analysis and a previous result of Gent and Wang ({GW}) (1991), as well as a result of Williams and Schapery or {WS} (1965). The role of strain hardening in determining the critical applied hydrostatic tension to fail a cavity is examined by comparing the numerical results using the above three constitutive models.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence was used to characterize the glass transition in thin and ultrathin supported polymer films with common chromophores. The temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity exhibits a transition or break upon cooling from the rubbery state to the glassy state, and this is identified as the glass transition. A variety of chromophores are investigated including pyrene, anthracene, and phenanthrene either as dopants, covalently attached to the polymer as a label, or both. The particular choice of the chromophore as well as the nature of the attachment, in the case of labels, have significant impact on the success of this method. Problematic cases include those in which the excited-state chromophore undergoes significant photochemistry in addition to fluorescence or those in which the particular attachment of the chromophore as a label may allow for conformational interactions that affect the fluorescence quantum yield in a nontrivial way. Polymers that have an intrinsic fluorescence unit, for example, polystyrene, may allow for the fluorescence sensing of the glass transition without added dopants or labels. Finally, it is demonstrated that this technique holds promise for the study of the glass transition in polymer blends and within specific locations in multilayer films.

Here the distribution of T(g)s across polystyrene films has been obtained by a fluorescence/multilayer method, revealing that the enhancement of dynamics at a surface affects T-g several tens of nanometres into the film. The extent to which dynamics smoothly transition from enhanced to bulk states depends strongly on nanoconfinement. When polymer films are sufficiently thin that a reduction in thickness leads to a reduction in overall T-g, the surface-layer T-g actually increases with a reduction in overall thickness, whereas the substrate-layer T-g decreases. These results indicate that the gradient in T-g dynamics is not abrupt, and that the size of a cooperatively rearranging region is much smaller than the distance over which interfacial effects propagate.},

We show that this problem can be alleviated by using microspheres as probes, and we establish the criteria for their use. The second relates to the common use of the Hertz contact mechanics model, which leads to significant errors when applied to thin samples. We develop novel, simple to use corrections to apply for such cases. Samples that are either bonded or not bonded to a rigid substrate are considered. The third problem concerns the difficulty in establishing when contact occurs on a soft material. We obtain error estimates for the elastic modulus resulting from such uncertainty and discuss the sensitivity of the estimation methods to error in contact point.

For this gel-indenter system, confinement is defined as the ratio of a0, the radius of the indenter, to h, the thickness of the elastic layer. In order to investigate geometric effects, the adhesion energy of the gel was kept constant while the thickness and modulus of the gels were varied. A fracture mechanics approach, based on the compliance of the layer, has been employed in analyzing the experimental data. It is shown that a fracture mechanics analysis is appropriate for these systems, allowing quantitative results to be obtained, despite very irregular contacts. It has also been shown that the interfacial instabilities observed during debonding maximize the compliance of the elastic layer. Additionally, four dimensionless parameters that dictate the behavior of confined systems have been defined, offering a general guide to understanding and characterizing the mechanical behavior of thin elastic layers.},

It is shown that the load-displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method.

	title = {Micromechanics of crack growth into a craze in a polymer glass},
	volume = {25},
	abstract = {The problem of craze failure near the tip of a crack embedded inside a craze is investigated in this work. Our micromechanics model is based on the presence of cross-tie fibrils in the craze microstructure. These cross-tie fibrils give the craze some small lateral load-bearing capacity so that they can transfer stress between the main fibrils. This load-transfer mechanism allows the normal stress on the fibrils directly ahead of the crack tip in the center of the craze to reach the breaking stress of the chains. An exact solution is obtained for the deformation field near the crack tip, and this solution is used to relate craze failure to the external loading and microstructural quantities such as the draw stress, the fibril spacing, and the chain breaking force. The relationship between energy flow to the crack tip due to external loading and the work of local fracture by fibril breakdown is also obtained. Our analysis shows that the normal stress sigma n acting on the fibrils at the crack tip increases linearly as the square root of the craze thickness assuming that the normal stress distribution is uniform and is equal to the drawing stress acting on the craze-bulk interface. However, our result shows that sigma n is very sensitive to the stress distribution at the craze-bulk interface so that the assumption of a constant draw stress acting on the craze-bulk interface ahead of the crack tip may underestimate sigma n. We also derived an approximate expression which relates the shear and tensile modulus of the crazed material to the underlying microstructural variables such as fibril spacing and fibril diameter.
