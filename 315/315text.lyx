Thermodynamics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kinetics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are fundamental skill sets/tool boxes required of all materials scientists/engi
neers.
 Thermodynamics tells us which phase or assemblage of phases has the absolute
 lowest free energy, and therefore represents the equilibrium state.
 (Note: there may be other metastable states at higher energies.) Kinetics
 tells us much more: how fast those phases will form, and the paths they
 will take along the way.
 Together, thermodynamics and kinetics determine the phase assemblages/microstru
ctures that can be obtained, and how to obtain them.
 In the materials science & engineering paradigm of Figure

The interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics can be illustrated with
 two case studies.
 The first involves the Fe-C phase diagram, which is introduced in virtually
 all introductory Materials Science & Engineering courses.

If we solutionize the eutectoid composition austenite (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

-phase) at the point indicated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, and then cool it (follow the arrow) below the eutectoid temperature (thermodyn
amics), various microstructures can result depending upon the rate of cooling
 (kinetics).
 Very slow cooling can result in discrete coarse-grained phases (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-phase austenite and cementite, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Fe_{3}C}$
\end_inset

).
 This assemblage of phases is not very strong or hard.
 On the other hand, by cooling more rapidly, we can produce a layered structure
 of austenite and cementite, referred to as pearlite for its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 appearance under the microscope.
 This microstructure is found to be quite strong and hard.
 This is a prime example of how the processing-structure

Later in this course we will learn about Richardson-Ellingham diagrams (for
 simplicity, these will be referred to as Ellingham diagrams).
 An Ellingham diagram is just a superposition of lines representing the
 free energy of oxidation for a large number of metals.
 A schematic of the Ellingham diagram for just silicon is given in Figure

\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

), respectively.) As we will see, the free energies of formation of all oxides,
 including silica, are strongly negative.
 This means that reactions like that in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:silicon oxid"

\end_inset

 have a strong tendency to go to the right, namely, to produce their oxide
 at the expense of the corresponding metal.
 If we throw an iron bar out in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elements,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we know that it rusts (forms the oxide) quite readily.
 However, an aluminum object, in spite of having an even larger negative
 free energy of oxidation than either iron or silicon, will hardly corrode
 under the same conditions.
 That is owing to the formation of a coherent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

passive
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 oxide film on the surface, through which diffusion is extremely slow.
 The same thing takes place on silicon, as illustrated in Figure

The passive

 film that forms is extremely important to the microelectronics at work
 in many computers.
 (Note: at present, silica is being replaced by oxides with larger dielectric
 constants, to ensure that the miniaturization necessary to keep extending
 Moore's Law, i.e., the number of transistors on a processor chip doubling
 every 18 months, can continue.) On the right side of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 part of the film has been intentionally removed (in a process known as
 photolithography) so that dopants can be introduced to change its electronic
 properties locally.
 This may take place by ion-implantation (using an ion beam) or it may take
 place by diffusion from a gaseous source.

 kinetics in both processing

In the first half of this text, we concentrate on the thermodynamics side
 of things, namely, the application of thermodynamics to the prediction
 and interpretation of phase diagrams.
 The level of presentation assumes two things: 1) You have had an introductory
 course in materials science and engineering, one that introduced simple
 phase diagrams, the phase rule, and the lever rule.
 2) You have a background in the laws of thermodynamics, and especially
 in the area of solution thermodynamics.
 If you know the difference between Raoultian and Henrian solution behavior
 and have been introduced to the Regular solution model, you will be in
 a good position to follow along.
 If not, it is suggested that you spend some time reading about basic solution
 thermodynamics.

 This equation only holds true for binary systems at fixed temperature and

 A more general form of the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be derived as follows.
 Let's start with a binary system.
 The total internal energy (U) is given by equation

The second law of thermodynamics (equation

\begin_layout Standard
For example, as we look at equation

\end_inset

, how many total variables do we have? The answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

four,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 including T (temperature), P (pressure), and two chemical potentials (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 But if we ask (for the case of a single phase) how many variables we need
 to control to establish thermodynamic equilibrium, the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

three.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For example, if we fix temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $dT=0$
\end_inset

), pressure (
\begin_inset Formula $dP=0$
\end_inset

), and the chemical potential of component 1 (
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu_{1}=0$
\end_inset

), then according to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 the other chemical potential must also be fixed (
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 Later we will understand degrees of freedom to be the number of thermodynamic
 variables that need to be fixed to establish equilibrium, or alternatively,

Since the moles are distributed between the two phases, it is not necessarily
 true that 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\alpha}=n^{\beta}$
\end_inset

, where the superscripts refer to the two phases.
 The same can be said of entropy or volume.
 Imagine ice floating in water.
 The two phases (solid, liquid) are in equilibrium, which we know by the
 fact that the temperature remains constant as long as there is any significant
 amount (moles, volume) of ice.
 But once all the ice melts, the water is free to rise in temperature.
 So what we need to do is to write two Gibbs-Duhem equations, one for the
 alpha phase (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Think for a minute about what equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 means.
 For a single-phase in a single-component system, equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:unaryGibbsDuhem"

\end_inset

 tells us that two thermodynamic potentials must be fixed in order to establish
 the equilibrium state.
 As pointed out above, in order to fix the chemical potential (
\begin_inset Formula $d\mu=0$
\end_inset

), we have to fix both temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $dT=0$
\end_inset

) and pressure (
\begin_inset Formula $dP=0$
\end_inset

).
 But now that we have two phases in equilibrium (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{\alpha}=\mu^{\beta}$
\end_inset

), we only need fix one variable.
 In equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PreClausClap"

\end_inset

 if pressure is fixed (
\begin_inset Formula $dP=0$
\end_inset

), then temperature must also be fixed (
\begin_inset Formula $dT=0$
\end_inset

), or vice versa; so we have decreased the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

degrees of freedom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by one by adding the second Gibbs-Duhem equation (the second phase in equilibri
um with the first).
 (Note: It is assumed that the molar volumes and molar entropies of the
 two phases are constant.) In other words, the coexistence of two phases
 in thermodynamic equilibrium requires the writing of two Gibbs-Duhem equations-
-one for each phase (equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:alphaunaryGD"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 of phases in equilibrium (

\end_inset

 We have thereby derived the Gibbs Phase Rule in equation

 Note that if we have three phases in thermodynamic equilibrium in a single-comp

 As you already know, this is a powerful equation for P-T diagrams.
 Given the molar volume difference between alpha and beta phases, from the
 slope of their P-T equilibrium phase boundary at a chosen

 we can calculate the enthalpy (and entropy) of the phase transformation,

 It would seem that the number of components should be 2 for the

 However, if the ratio of hydrogen-to-oxygen remains constant for all phases

 phase diagrams for each case are given in the second row of diagrams.
 For example, a conventional P-T diagram like that of water is a good example
 of a Type I diagram.
 However, you may have noticed a couple of anomalies in the other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

representative
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 diagrams.
 For example, the schematic (and easy to recognize) Type II binary eutectic
 diagram does not have 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 as its x-axis.
 There is a good reason for this.
 Think of what happens if we let 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{A}$
\end_inset

 go to zero.
 This would result in an infinite value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, we use mole fraction (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=n_{B}/(n_{A}+n_{B})$
\end_inset

), which is zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}=0$
\end_inset

 and unity for 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{A}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PeltonScheme"

\end_inset

 that mole fraction can be easily related to the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{A}/n_{B}$
\end_inset

, which is just the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The other anomaly is that we seldom, if ever, see Type III ternary diagrams
 in rectilinear form, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{C}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason is pretty obvious.

\begin_layout Standard
Given the well-known phase diagram of water (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Schematic PT H2O"

\end_inset

), Type I phase diagrams are mistakenly thought of as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or single-component phase diagrams, but this is incorrect.
 Type I diagrams can be unary, binary or even higher.
 But they all have in common the plotting of one thermodynamic potential
 vs.
 another.
 They also share in common that the interpretation is the same for all Type
 I diagrams, as we will show.
 In fact, this is true for each category of diagrams; the rules of interpretatio
n are identical within each type.

\begin_layout Standard

 The first (a) is a repeat of the single-component

\end_inset

 phase diagram.
 The second (b) is a 
\begin_inset Formula $T-\mu_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 diagram of the two-component Ni-O system.
 The third diagram (c) is a slighty different version of the 
\begin_inset Formula $Ni-O$
\end_inset

 binary system.
 
\emph on
This
\emph default
 is actually a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{O_{2}}-T$
\end_inset

 diagram in disguise, as we later show.
 The top lines on this diagram are actually taken from a very special Type
 I diagram, known as the Richardson-Ellingham diagram (shown later).
 We will refer to this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ellingham

\end_inset

 diagram, and will spend quite a bit of time with it shortly.
 The final Type I phase diagram (d) is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{S_{2}}-\mu_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 diagram for the Cu-S-O ternary system.
 Such diagrams are referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stability area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 diagrams or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 diagrams.
 The descriptor, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stability area,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is quite informative.
 It speaks to the fact that interpretation is identical for all Type I phase
 diagrams: areas represent single-phase regimes (or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

/range of thermodynamic potentials over which a given phase is solely 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

); lines represent the combination of the thermodynamic potentials required
 for co-equilibrium of two phases; 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

triple points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (where three lines meet) indicate the thermodynamic conditions (potentials)
 where co-equilibrium of three phases occurs.
 Note that in going from a one-component system (
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}O$
\end_inset

) to a two component system (
\begin_inset Formula $Ni-O$
\end_inset

), one of the thermodynamic potentials, in this case pressure (
\begin_inset Formula $P=$
\end_inset

1 atm), must be held constant to arrive at a Type I diagram (equilibrium
 being determined by the two potentials on the axes).
 And in going further to a three-component system (
\begin_inset Formula $Cu-S-O$
\end_inset

) two thermodynamic potentials, in this case pressure (
\begin_inset Formula $P=$
\end_inset

1 atm) and temperature (

1000K), must be held constant to arrive at a Type I diagram (equilibrium

In 1944, it was observed (by Ellingham) that plots of standard free energy

It can be seen that the first two terms, the standard entropy terms of the
 two solids (calcium oxide, calcium), roughly cancel and that the overall
 value is dominated by the standard entropy of the oxygen gas (the third
 term).
 Hence, the slopes of all oxidation reactions on Ellingham diagrams involving
 solid metals and oxides will be very similar, owing to the fact that

At first, this may seem like a complicated diagram.
 However, the following discussion and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

case studies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should help to simplify it and demonstrate its usefulness.
 As can be seen there are three different nomographic scales on the sides
 of the diagram.
 These were added by Richardson; hence, the diagram is often referred to
 the Richardson-Ellingham diagram.
 We will highlight each of these scales as we come to them.
 First let's consider three ways to arrive at a specific 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\,\mathrm{or\,}\Delta G^{o},T$
\end_inset

 coordinate on the diagram.
 Consider the reaction of Ti with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{O_{2}(g)}$
\end_inset

 to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
 From the line and the diagram legend we know that both the metal and the
 oxide are solids at this temperature, because we do not encounter an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol (where the metal melts) until much higher temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T\sim1650^{o}C$
\end_inset

), and there is no boxed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol, which stands for the melting point of the oxide.
 This means that the oxide melts at a temperature above the melting point
 of the metal, however no thermodynamic data are provided for higher temperature
s.
 Note: a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol is fairly rare and corresponds to the boiling point of the metal,
 as in the case of Mg and Ca, the bottommost lines on the diagram.
 The large increase in slope at such a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 point is due to the fact that both reactants on the left side of the Ellingham
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Ellingham eq"

\end_inset

 are in gaseous form (oxygen gas plus metal vapor) and therefore contribute
 to the entropy or slope of the line.

\begin_layout Standard
The three ways to reach a specific coordinate are illustrated in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Three-paths-to"

\end_inset

.
 The first way or path (1) to reach the coordinates in question is by what
 I call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct read.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The topmost horizontal line of the Ellingham diagram, directly below the
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{H_{2}}/p_{H_{2}O}\,\mathrm{or\,}p_{CO}/p_{CO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 nomographic scales, is the line of zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

 we draw an arrow down from this line until we hit the line representing
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ti/TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 equilibrium at a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}\sim-690kJ/mole$
\end_inset

.
 This is illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Three-paths-to"

\end_inset

.
 The second path (2) to reach the same coordinates is to use the Ellingham
 relation in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Ell deltaG"

\end_inset

.
 This is also illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Three-paths-to"

\end_inset

.
 It is important to realize where the coordinates (0,0) occur on the diagram.
 On the very left of the Ellingham diagram in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-Ellingham-diagram"

\end_inset

 is a vertical line with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

0 K
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 indicated.
 Since the x-axis is in degrees C, the absolute zero in degrees Kelvin is
 to the left another 
\begin_inset Formula $-273.15^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
 So the actual (0,0) point of the Ellingham diagram is at the top left corner
 where the line which passes through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

H
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points makes an angle with the horizontal line of zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a very important point on the Ellingham diagram, which I tend to
 call the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 point (O for oxygen) and later the O-fulcrum.
 Starting at the O-point, we can draw the 
\begin_inset Formula $A+BT$
\end_inset

 line from the origin as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Three-paths-to"

\end_inset

.
 One can crudely think of this in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H^{o}-T\Delta S^{o}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ti/TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 equilibrium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the way, there is perfectly good thermodynamic reason why Ellingham did
 not extend the lines on the diagram below 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
 You may recall from your basic thermodynamics background that the heat
 capacity of a solid begins to vary dramatically below its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Debye
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 temperature approaching absolute zero.
 This would make for large deviations from linearity of the lines on the
 Ellingham diagram below 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{o}C$
\end_inset

 approaching 
\begin_inset Formula $0K$
\end_inset

; hence, the lines terminate at 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third way or path to reach the same coordinates of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}\sim-690kJ/mole$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

 requires some explanation.
 As found in basic chemistry textbooks we know from equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deltaGandQ"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 of a reaction is related to the standard free energy of that reaction plus
 a second term that depends upon the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

activity quotient
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or Q.
 In the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ti/TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 this becomes equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the activities of the solid phases can be assumed to be unity (assuming
 pure metal and oxide) and the activity of oxygen is given by its partial
 pressure.
 However, if the metal and oxide are in equilibrium we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G=0$
\end_inset

, yielding the following equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deltavsKeq"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta G^{o}=-RT\ln K_{eq}=-RT\ln\frac{1}{p_{O_{2}}^{eq}}=RT\ln p_{O_{2}}^{eq}\label{eq:deltavsKeq}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 is the oxygen partial pressure where 
\begin_inset Formula $Ti(s)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $TiO_{2}(s)$
\end_inset

 are in equilibrium.
 In effect, path (3) is a line with zero intercept and a slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $R\ln p_{_{O_{2}}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 temperature, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Three-paths-to"

\end_inset

.
 We can solve mathematically for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 by plugging 
\begin_inset Formula $-690kJ/mole$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

 or rather 1273K into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:deltavsKeq"

\end_inset

 to arrive at a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.9\times10^{-29}atm$
\end_inset

, for which the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 (base 10) is -28.3.
 This is where the nomographic scale comes in handy.
 If we draw a line from the origin or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O-point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 through the coordinates in question (the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ti/TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 line at 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

) to the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 nomographic scale, we get approximately the same value.
 Keep in mind that this is really a log scale, so we must interpolate the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logs,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for example one quarter of the way from 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-28}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-30}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-28.5}$
\end_inset

 and definitely not 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times10^{-29}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times10^{-28}$
\end_inset

.
 So we have a short cut or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy button
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for finding the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 value for any set of coordinates on the Ellingham diagram.
 Simply take a ruler and connect it from the O-point through the coordinates
 in question and read the 
\begin_inset Formula $\log p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 value off the nomographic scale.
 Since all lines radiate from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O-point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I tend to refer to this point as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O-fulcrum.
 You will note on the Ellingham diagram that all the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

tick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 marks on the O-nomographic scale point back to the O-fulcrum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, achieving such a low oxygen partial pressure is impossible with
 even the best available vacuum systems.
 That is where the outer two nomographic scales come in.

Let's go back to the situation we considered above, namely the

\end_inset

 equilibrium at 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

 with an equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $4.9\times10^{-29}$
\end_inset

.
 Given the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we can solve for an R value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.26\times10^{7}$
\end_inset

.
 On a base 10 log scale this corresponds to 7.1.
 Now let's use the second nomographic scale and its corresponding C-fulcrum
 (this is the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the line to the left side of the Ellingham diagram 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) to solve the same problem.
 Note that all the tick marks on the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{CO}/p_{CO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 radiate from the C-fulcrum.
 As illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The C nomogr scale"

\end_inset

, using a ruler to draw a line from the C-fulcrum through the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ti/TiO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 line where it crosses 
\begin_inset Formula $1000^{o}C$
\end_inset

 all the way to the second nomographic scale and we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{7.1}$
\end_inset

, in excellent agreement with the calculations.
 Even though the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{CO_{2}}$
\end_inset

 would be quite small (on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-7}$
\end_inset

 atm) this is still way larger than the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

, so our assumption that the amount of oxygen can be neglected is mathematically
 justified.
 In reality, however, just as with aqueous buffers, there are limits to
 buffer reliability.
 For example, buffer gases become unreliable if the R value is too large
 or too small, owing to the potential for oxygen 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

leaks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the lines feeding gases into a commercial furnace.
 Therefore, buffer gases are usually limited to values of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}\leq r_{c}\leq10^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, we have a valuable short cut to obtain the 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{c}$
\end_inset

 value for any coordinates on the Ellingham diagram.

 a ruler to draw a line between the H-fulcrum through those coordinates

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, Ellingham diagrams are characterized by the following features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Curves in Ellingham diagrams for the formation of metallic oxides are basically
 straight lines with a positive slope.
 The slope is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S$
\end_inset

, which is fairly constant with temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The lower position of a metal's line in the Ellingham diagram, the greater
 is the stability of its oxide.
 For example, the line for Al (oxidation of aluminum) is found to be below
 that for Fe (formation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Stability of metallic oxides decreases with increasing temperature.
 Highly unstable oxides like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Ag_{2}O}$
\end_inset

 and HgO easily undergo thermal decomposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A reduced substance (such as a metal), whose Gibbs free energy of formation
 is lower on the diagram at a given temperature, will reduce an oxide whose
 free energy of formation is higher on the diagram.
 For example, metallic aluminum can reduce iron oxide to metallic iron,
 with the aluminum itself being oxidized to aluminum oxide.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The greater the gap between any two lines, the greater the effectiveness
 of the reducing agent corresponding to the lower line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Two More Type I Phase Diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So regardless of the method used to obtain the driving force, it is obvious
 that that driving force is negative; reaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Mn/MnOrxn"

\end_inset

 will proceed to the right and Mn metal will be oxidized to its oxide.
 This also allows us to see that we can make a Type I phase diagram out
 of each "line" (or metal/oxide pair) on the Ellingham diagram.
 If we consider the Mn/MnO "line" in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:EllinghamPD"

\end_inset

, it follows that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct read
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arrow from any set of coordinates above the line (corresponding oxygen
 pressures larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

) to the equilibrium Mn/MnO line will be negative, i.e., the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 will be negative so the oxide will be favored.
 On the other hand, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

direct read
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arrow from any set of coordinates below the line (corresponding to oxygen
 pressures smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

) to the equilibrium Mn/MnO line will be positive, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 will be positive so the reaction of does not proceed; the metal will be
 stable.
 Therefore manganese oxide exists everywhere above the "line" and manganese
 metal exists everywhere below the "line." But there are two different forms
 of manganese metal and therefore two Type I phase boundaries: one between
 the solid oxide and the solid metal, below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(Mn)$
\end_inset

, and another between the solid oxide and the liquid metal, above 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(Mn)$
\end_inset

.
 So at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(Mn)$
\end_inset

 we get a Type I triple point.
 The vertical phase boundary at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(Mn)$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the melting of Mn; solid Mn is stable to the left and liquid
 Mn is stable to the right.
 This vertical line intersects the other two at the triple point, where
 both solid and liquid Mn exist in equilibrium with solid MnO.

A more useful Type I phase diagram for the laboratory, however, is a plot

.
 For example, we can convert the Ellingham-type phase diagram of Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 into such a diagram for the Mn-MnO system by either 1) using the O-nomographic
 scale over and over to estimate the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\log p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 for Mn/MnO equilibrium each temperature, or 2) solving 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G^{o}=RT\ln p_{O_{2}}^{eq}$
\end_inset

 for each temperature, given the thermodynamic data for reaction 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 A schematic of this diagram is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mn-OschemTvsLogpo2"

\end_inset

.
 There are many applications of such diagrams.
 For example, in Mn metal heat treating, we want to keep the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{app}$
\end_inset

 below the pressure of the phase boundary with MnO.
 For ceramists dealing the MnO the opposite would hold true: we would want
 to maintain the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}^{app}$
\end_inset

 above that of the oxygen partial pressure of the phase boundary with either
 solid or liquid Mn.

We can apply Gibbs' phase rule to both kinds of phase diagrams.
 We know that F=C+2-
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

, however, the overall pressure is understood to be 1 atm for both diagrams,
 so the phase rule reduces to F=C+1-
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

.
 As opposed to the water P-T phase diagram where the H:O ratio was everywhere
 2 on the diagram, here the O:Mn ratio differs from phase field to phase
 field (e.g., it is 1:1 for MnO but 0:1 for Mn); hence, C=2 (for Mn and O).
 This yields a phase rule of F=3-
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$

 must be specified, two-phase situations are phase boundaries/lines of F=1,
 i.e., if we fix one variable (say T), we immediately know the other (
\begin_inset Formula $\log p_{O_{2}}$

) or vice versa, and three-phase situations have zero degrees of freedom
 at three-line junctions or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

triple points.

 Type II phase diagrams are really quite different from Type I phase diagrams.
 Instead of two thermodynamic potential axes, one of the axes is a ratio
 of conjugate extensive variables.
 Later, when dealing with free energy vs.
 composition diagrams, we will return to answering the question of how a
 potential axis can be replaced by a

 axis to establish thermodynamic equilibrium.
 For now, suffice it to say that if we eliminate the -VdP term in the Gibbs-Duhe

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can chose to fix T and one of the chemical potentials (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{A}or\mu_{B}$
\end_inset

), which is relatively difficult to do, or one can chose to fix T and the
 ratio of the moles of B to the moles of A.
 Fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 is inconvenient, however, since at one extreme (
\begin_inset Formula $n_{A}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

) the ratio goes to infinity.
 Instead, as you well know, we fix the mole fraction of B, as seen in the
 x-axis of the common binary eutectic phase diagram sketched schematically
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 The following sections deal with how we can estimate each type of phase
 boundary (liquidus, solidus, solvus) in Type II phase diagrams from the
 simple solution thermodynamic models you already know (Raoultian, Henrian,
 Regular), as long as we make some simplifying assumptions.
 More complicated situations are better handled by software dedicated to
 predicting phase diagrams, taking into account more sophisticated models
 and behavior of individual solutions.
 Such software programs are discussed briefly at the end of this text.
 But for now, the following sections will build confidence in linking phase
 diagrams with their underlying solution thermodynamic origins, and will
 hopefully cause you to think about and question the specific models that
 lie behind the "black boxes" of modern phase diagram algorithms.

denoting a liquid solution.
 Of course, we know from solution thermodynamics that there is no such thing
 as a perfectly pure solid.
 The assumption of liquid ideality just means that the activity of each
 component in the liquid is approximately equal to its mole fraction (
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=X_{i}$

 Given these two assumptions, it is fairly straightforward to estimate the
 liquidus line for a "negligible solid solubility" system.

 However, the temperature of equilibrium in Figure

 Modern software packages can account for changes in enthalpy and entropy
 for pure liquid and solid A at different temperatures.
 But we can at least make an estimate of what might happen by employing
 a further simplification, and assume that the enthalpy of melting is approximat
ely constant and does not change significantly with temperature.
 This is often referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta c_{p}\approx0$

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solid A and pure liquid A is negligible such that the enthalpy of melting
 is approximately temperature-independent.
 This gives the following equation

 First of all, the falling liquidus lines are examples of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

freezing point lowering.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This important phenomenon is used to advantage on icy streets by applying
 salt, which lowers the freezing point of ice.
 Of course, this requires that the ice melt and the liquid dissolve some

 Upon refreezing, however, the liquidus (first occurrence of solid water)
 is not reached until a significantly lower temperature.
 Furthermore, when we drop the temperature still lower, we enter a two-phase
 region where ice is in equilibrium with liquid salt solution, a mixture
 we commonly refer to as

 do not occur in nature.
 If they did, they would spontaneously react with any water to form C-S-H

Estimating Liquidus and Solidus Lines for a Binary Isomorphous System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous example we were dealing with a continuous liquid solution,
 but negligible solid solution.
 But what happens if both liquid and solid solutions are continuous across
 the A-B phase diagram? An example of such a phase diagram is shown schematicall
y in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinIsomorph"

\end_inset

, where the upper line is the liquidus and the lower line is the solidus.
 This is a very unique situation that only happens if the end-member solids
 obey certain requirements, as put forth in the well-known Hume-Rothery
 rules: 1) the two solids must have the same crystal structure, 2) the two
 species should have similar electronegativities, and 3) their atomic radii
 must not differ by more than 15 percent.
 Thermodynamically speaking, the enthalpies of mixing should be nearly the
 same for the liquid solution as for the solid solution, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H_{ls}^{M}\simeq\Delta H_{ss}^{M}$
\end_inset

.
 For our estimation of liquidus and solidus lines we will assume both enthalpies
 of solution to be zero, or that both solutions are ideal or Raoultian.

Before the development of chemical vapor deposition, currently employed
 to purify silicon to transistor-grade levels (impurities at parts per billion!)
, a method called "zone-refining" was used to clean up crystalline ingots
 of silicon.
 The idea can be understood from the binary isomorphous diagram of Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinIsomorph"

\end_inset

.
 Let component "B" be silicon.
 If we melt silicon with an impurity content at the left end of the equilibrium
 line in the figure, it can be seen that the solid crystallizing from the
 melt is significantly cleaner.
 Suppose we could isolate this cleaner solid.
 If we could repeat the process with this solid, melting it and crystallizing
 it, the composition of the solid would move progressively to the right,
 toward higher purity silicon.
 In fact, this was accomplished by repeated passes of a localized heater
 along the length of a cylindrical silicon crystal held at nearly its melting
 point.
 The "molten zone" was held in place by surface tension and it concentrated
 impurities and took them along for the ride.
 This happened to impurities with a positive "distribution coefficient,"
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $k=X(s)/X(\ell)>1$
\end_inset

 as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinIsomorph"

\end_inset

.
 Impurities with a negative distribution coefficient went the opposite direction
 and were left behind.
 Either way, with each pass of the "molten zone" the central portion of
 the crystalline ingot became more and more pure, as the impurities were
 dragged/left behind at the ends, which were cut off and discarded.

This equation also has special significance, namely the second derivative

 Outside of each inflection point, marked with a square, the second derivative
 is positive (the curve is concave up) whereas in the middle the the second
 derivative is negative (the curve is concave down).
 You will discuss in later materials science and engineering coursework
 the importance of these "spinodes," especially with respect to a process

\begin_layout Standard
To arrive at useful forms of both derivative functions, we need to take
 yet another derivative.
 It turns out that at the very top of the solvus in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SolvusPlot"

\end_inset

 all three derivatives are zero.
 The third derivative of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:IdMixEntropy-1"

\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial^{3}\Delta G^{M}}{\partial X_{B}^{3}}\right)=RT\left[\frac{1}{X_{A}^{2}}-\frac{1}{X_{B}^{2}}\right]\label{eq:RegSol3rdDer}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can begin to put all the derivatives to good use.
 For the third derivative to be zero requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}=X_{B}=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 This tells us that the top of the solvus is at the equimolar composition
 as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SolvusPlot"

\end_inset

.
 But the second derivative is also zero at the top of the solvus.
 For equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RegSol2ndDer"

\end_inset

 to be zero requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Omega/RT=1/X_{A}+1/X_{B}=1/0.5+1/0.5=4$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=2RT$
\end_inset

.
 We refer to this as the "critical" temperature, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{cr}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{cr}=\Omega/2R$
\end_inset

.
 This is an important relationship.
 Given the critical temperature or top of the solvus in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SolvusPlot"

\end_inset

, we can estimate the interaction parameter.
 Or given the interaction parameter, we can estimate the top of the solvus.
 Now let's plug these results into the first derivative equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RegSol1stDer"

\end_inset

, also setting it equal to zero:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\ln X_{A}+\ln X_{B}=\ln\frac{X_{B}}{X_{A}}=\frac{\Omega}{RT}(X_{B}-X_{A})=\frac{2RT_{cr}}{RT}(X_{B}-X_{A})\label{eq:RegSoln1stDerMod}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or more simply:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln\frac{X_{B}}{X_{A}}=\frac{2T_{cr}}{T}\left(X_{B}-X_{A}\right)\label{eq:RegSolnSolvus}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two solutions (phase boundaries) to this equation.
 For example, if we chose a temperature 80% of the critical temperature
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $T/T_{cr}=0.8$
\end_inset

 the two solutions are at 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=0.145$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=0.855$
\end_inset

, the latter being the symmetrical solution (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}=0.145$
\end_inset

).
 In the lower diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SolvusPlot"

\end_inset

 the lowest free energy situation between the two phase boundaries is to
 strike out along the dashed line, meaning an assemblage of two separate
 phases rather than a continuous solid solution, which is at higher free
 energies.
 It is actually easier to isolate T in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RegSolnSolvus"

\end_inset

 and solve for it by plugging in a composition.
 To obtain the following equation, remember that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}=1-X_{B}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}-X_{A}=X_{B}-(1-X_{B})=2X_{B}-1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T=\frac{2T_{cr}(2X_{B}-1)}{\ln\left(\frac{X_{B}}{1-X_{B}}\right)}\label{eq:RegSolSolvusTversion}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, don't forget the two solutions at each temperature; the second 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$
\end_inset

 solution is the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}$
\end_inset

 for the first solution.
 To find the "spinodes," we need to set the second derivative equal to zero.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1/X_{A}+1/X_{B}\right)$
\end_inset

 on the right side of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RegSol2ndDer"

\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(X_{B}+X_{A}\right)/X_{A}X_{B}$
\end_inset

, which is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1/X_{A}X_{B}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 For the second derivative to be zero requires that 
\begin_inset Formula $2\Omega/RT=(1/X_{A}+1/X_{B})$
\end_inset

 or:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
2\frac{\Omega}{RT}=2\frac{2RT_{cr}}{RT}=\frac{4T_{cr}}{T}=\frac{1}{X_{A}X_{B}}\label{eq:RegSolnSpinode}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inverting both sides of this equation yields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{T}{4T_{cr}}=X_{A}X_{B}=(1-X_{B})X_{B}=X_{B}-X_{B}^{2}\label{eq:RegSolnSpinRaw}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This turns out to be a simple quadratic function, which can be readily solved
 for composition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{B}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4(\frac{T}{4T_{cr}})}}{2}=\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4\left(\frac{T}{T_{cr}}\right)}}{2}\label{eq:RegSolSpinFin}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, there are two solutions at every temperature.
 For example, at 
\begin_inset Formula $0.8T_{cr}$
\end_inset

 the two solutions are 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=$
\end_inset

0.276 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=$
\end_inset

0.724.
 There is much more to spinodes and spinodal decomposition than these very
 simplified equations, as you will discover in higher level materials coursework.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the binary isomorphous phase diagram in Figure

 As above, we will consider both liquid and solid solutions to behave

ideally,

 meaning that they each follow Raoult's Law (

 The line follows Raoult's Law, hence the

 Since pure liquid B and pure solid B are in equilibrium at

\begin_layout Standard
However, consider a temperature midway between the two melting temperatures
 (T*), as depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ActCompBinIso"

\end_inset

.
 It makes sense to chose pure solid B as the standard state, since we are
 well below the melting point of B.
 The plot immediately below the phase diagram shows how the activity changes
 with composition.
 We always start with the phase that is in the same state as the standard
 state.
 In this case we begin at the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(s)=1$
\end_inset

 point (top right) and begin working backwards down the dashed Raoult's
 Law line until we reach the two-phase equilibrium between liquid solution
 and solid solution.
 In a two-component system at fixed temperature and pressure the degrees
 of freedom are 2- 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

, or zero in the two-phase region.
 This requires that both chemical potential and thermodynamic activity be
 constant in this region, marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EQ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for equilibrium.
 The leftmost regime is seemingly straightforward, since we know that thermodyna
mic activity must go to zero at zero composition.
 But this region is also labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RL,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yet the line drawn is far from the dashed line for Raoult's Law.
 The reason is that we are now dealing with a liquid solution on a plot
 for which the standard state is pure B solid.
 In fact, if we extrapolate Raoult's Law in the liquid solution all the
 way to the right side of the activity plot, we obtain the activity of pure
 liquid B (if it could be obtained at this temperature) with respect to
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WRT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) pure solid B being the standard state and having unit activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the bottommost activity plot, we have chosen pure liquid B to be the
 standard state, having unit activity.
 But here we must start our activity plot in the regime where liquid exists,
 which is on the left side of the phase diagram in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ActCompBinIso"

\end_inset

.
 We know that the activity must be zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}=0,$
\end_inset

 so (0,0) is our starting point.
 Since we have assumed a Raoultian liquid, the activity follows Raoult's
 Law (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) until the two-phase equilibrium (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EQ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) between liquid and solid solutions, where the activity is constant.
 The rightmost region is also labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

RL
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for Raoult's Law, but is again far from the dashed Raoult's Law line.
 Again, the reason is that we are now dealing with a solid solution on a
 plot for which the standard state is pure B liquid (if it could be obtained
 at this temperature).
 By fitting a line from the (0,0) point through the rightmost circled point
 of the two-phase equilibrium and continuing it to the right side of the
 diagram, we obtain the activity of pure solid B with respect to (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WRT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) pure liquid B being the standard state at T*.
 It can be shown that the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)/a_{B}^{o}$
\end_inset

(s) is the same for the two diagrams.
 Furthermore, it is determined by the free energy of melting or fusion of
 component B, as we will now show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the two-phase equilibrium between liquid solution and solid solution,
 we can write the following relationships between chemical potential and

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until now, we have always assumed the standard state activity to be unity,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{o}=1$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}/a_{i}^{o}=a_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 However, now we can make a choice as to which standard state we set equal
 to unity.
 If we consider the two-phase equilibrium in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}(s)=\mu_{B}(\ell)$
\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

 from equation

\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}^{o}(\ell)-\mu_{B}^{o}(s)$

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta c_{p}\approx0$

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This provides the explanation for how the activity vs.
 composition plots behave in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 At 
\begin_inset Formula $T=T_{m}(B)$
\end_inset

 the right side of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:StdStateApprox"

\end_inset

 is zero; the two standard state activities are the same (
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(s)=a_{B}^{o}(\ell)=1)$
\end_inset

.
 However, at other temperatures, we have the choice of which standard state
 activity we set equal to unity, hence the two diagrams for the temperature
 T*.
 If we divide both sides of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:StdStateApprox"

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $RT$
\end_inset

 and exponentiate, we find that at a fixed temperature less than 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(B)$
\end_inset

 (e.g., T*) the activity ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)/a_{B}^{o}(s)$
\end_inset

 is a constant and is greater than unity, given that the right side of equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:StdStateApprox"

\end_inset

 is now positive.
 If we set 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(s)=1$
\end_inset

, it follows that the projected activity of pure liquid B (if it could exist
 at T*) would have an activity greater than unity.
 On the other hand, if we set 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)=1$
\end_inset

 it follows that the projected activity of pure solid B will have a value
 less than unity, as on the lower diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ActCompBinIso"

\end_inset

.
 It should be stressed, however, that Raoult's Law is really 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}=X_{B}a_{B}^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 When dealing with the same 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (liquid or solid solution) as the standard state, it is understood that
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}=1$

RL
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 However, when dealing with the opposite 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (liquid or solid solution) from the standard state, Raoult's Law will still
 be a line, but its slope will be governed by the activity ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)/a_{B}^{o}(s)$
\end_inset

.
 In the lower two activity plots of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we draw a line from the origin to or through the point at which we know
 the activity relative to the opposing standard state scale.
 In the bottom diagram, this linear projection ends at the activity of pure
 B solid with respect to pure B liquid having unit activity.

We can also draw schematic activity vs.

 assumption that the solid solutions are "dilute" solutions.
 A dilute solution is one for which the solute (the minor component) behaves

 behaves in a Raoult's Law fashion.
 In fact, it can be proven that if the solute is Henrian, the solvent must
 be Raoultian.
 In a dilute solution, the solute (B) atoms are only surrounded by A atoms.

 This means that over the composition range that the solute behaves in a

 The activity of B follows Raoult's Law across the diagram.
 Similarly, at the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 the behavior is quite similar to what we saw with the binary isomorphous
 phase diagram.
 We have the choice of B two standard states: solid and liquid.
 In each diagram we have a two-phase equilibrium ("EQ") separating two Raoult's
 Law lines (one for the liquid and one for the solvent of the "dilute" solution
 on the right) and the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)/a_{B}^{o}(s)$
\end_inset

 is a constant.
 If we assume further that the enthalpy of melting of pure B is roughly
 temperature-independent, we can invoke equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:StdStateApprox"

\end_inset

 to estimate the ratio, given the melting temperature and melting enthalpy
 of B.

 the situation is a bit more complicated, as depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:EutecticActComp2B"

\end_inset

.
 If we chose solid B as the standard state, we would begin on the right
 of the diagram and follow the dashed line for Raoult's Law (B being the
 ideal solvent) down to the phase boundary of the two-phase regime, where
 the activity would be constant owing to equilibrium "EQ" between liquid
 solution and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 solid solution.
 The third line is marked "RL" for Raoult's Law, since we have assumed that
 the liquid solution behaves this way.
 The reason that this "RL" line lies above the dashed line is that this
 is Raoult's Law in the liquid solution with respect to pure solid B having
 unit activity.
 To obtain this line, simply draw a line from the origin through the leftmost
 point of the previous "EQ" situation.
 The extrapolation of this line to the right side of the diagram would give
 the activity of pure liquid B (if it could be obtained at this temperature)
 with respect to pure solid B.
 Continuing to the left on the plot, we have yet another two-phase equilibrium
 (between liquid solution and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 solid solution) and a horizontal "EQ" situation.
 The final regime is strictly in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 phase, for which the B-component is the dilute solute, hence Henry's Law
 ("HL") is obeyed.

 B liquid, shown in the bottom diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 As before, we must begin where the phase in question is in the same state
 as the standard state (liquid).
 So we start in the very middle of the diagram where liquid solution exists
 by itself.
 The activity of B must fall on the standard Raoult's law 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}=X_{B}$
\end_inset

 dashed line as shown.
 At each end of this

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 solid solution on the right.
 These are the two horizontal segments marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EQ
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 on the plot.
 The final segment on the left brings the activity to zero at the origin
 of the plot.
 This segment is marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

HL
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for Henry's Law, since B is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dilute
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 solute in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 solid solution.
 For the final segment on the right, we know that B is the solvent in the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 solid solution, and should behave according to Raoult's Law as marked on
 the diagram.
 However, this is Raoult's law in the solid solution with respect to pure
 liquid B being the standard state.
 Therefore the segment falls on a lower line extrapolated from the origin
 through the activity at the rightmost point of the two-phase liquid solution-
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 equilibrium (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

EQ
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Where it strikes the right axis of the plot corresponds to the activity
 of pure solid B with respect to pure liquid B having unit activity.
 As with the binary isomorphous example, the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{B}^{o}(\ell)/a_{B}^{o}(s)$
\end_inset

 in the two lower plots must be the same.
 Again, if we assume that the enthalpy of melting of pure B is roughly temperatu
re-independent, we can invoke equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to estimate the ratio, given the melting temperature and melting enthalpy

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows how the activity of B varies with composition.
 We start by defining pure solid B as the standard state.
 Since B is the solvent in the

 solid solution, the plot follows Raoult's Law until the two-phase equilibrium
 between the

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are very important equations.
 For example, equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:TangInt8"

\end_inset

 tells us that if we take the slope of the G vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$
\end_inset

 curve at any point (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}^{'}$
\end_inset

in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Tangent"

\end_inset

) and place the corresponding line on the diagram, the right intercept will
 be the chemical potential of B at that particular composition (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}^{'}$
\end_inset

).
 This follows from the left side of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:TangInt8"

\end_inset

.
 The sum of the absolute value of G at that composition plus the product
 of the mole fraction of A (marked as "run" on the diagram) and the slope
 
\begin_inset Formula $dG/dX_{B}$
\end_inset

 (marked "rise/run" on the diagram) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}$
\end_inset

 at that composition.
 Similarly, at the left end of this tangent line will be the chemical potential
 of component A at that same composition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This procedure is often referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

method of tangential intercepts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It is important for several reasons: 1) It conclusively proves that we
 can fix two chemical potentials by fixing the ratio of two conjugate extensive
 variables, in this case the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 or rather the mole fraction, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/(n_{A}+n_{B}).$
\end_inset

 2) Given a specific G vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$
\end_inset

 curve, we can determine the chemical potentials at any composition.
 3) Since we know the chemical potential of the pure end-members A (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{A}^{o}$
\end_inset

) and B (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{B}^{o}$
\end_inset

), namely the extreme ends of each G vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$
\end_inset

 curve, we can also know the activity at any composition using the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}=\mu_{i}^{o}+RT\ln a_{i}$
\end_inset

 relationship.
 4) Finally, if we have two phases in equilibrium, they must share the same
 common tangent and intercepts so that the chemical potentials and activities
 are the same in both phases.
 We will illustrate this when we draw schematic free energy vs.
 composition curves for actual phase diagrams (below).

\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first derivative of this equation with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the limit that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}\rightarrow1$

\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 These hold true regardless of the size of the interaction parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 In the middle of the phase diagram the liquid solution (ls) has the lowest

 But beyond the liquidus curves to left and right we have two-phase equilibria

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 solid solution on the left and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 solid solution on the right.
 The lowest free energy situation in each case is along the respective line

At the eutectic temperature all three phases (ls,

In this case, the solid solution on either side of the phase diagram is
 essentially the same solid solution with the same crystal structure.
 However, owing to interaction between the A and B atoms, the solid solution
 is prone to phase-separation.
 We described this previously, making use of the Regular solution model
 with a positive interaction parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 is below the eutectic temperature.
 As shown in the diagram to the right, the free energy vs.
 composition curve for the liquid solution lies everywhere above that of
 the solid solution.
 However, the free energy vs.
 composition curve for the solid solution is consistent with phase separation
 into two solid solutions, 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{2}.$
\end_inset

 At the eutectic temperature, all three "phases" share the same common tangent
 line.
 The solidus and solvus lines intersect the horizontal eutectic line at
 the maximum solubilities (of B in 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{1}$
\end_inset

 and of A in 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 Any composition between these points will exhibit a three-phase microstructure
 involving differing amounts of 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{1}$
\end_inset

 solid soution, liquid solution, and 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{2}$
\end_inset

 solid solution, depending upon overall composition.
 The temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 lies above the eutectic temperature.
 In the middle of the phase diagram the liquid solution (ls) has the lowest
 free energy.
 But beyond the liquidus curves to left and right we have two-phase equilibria
 between liquid solution and either 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The lowest free energy situation in each case is along the respective line
 of common tangency, as shown.
 In these two-phase regions, the chemical potentials can be found at the
 extremes of the associated common tangent line.
 Beyond the solidus lines to the left and right, the lowest energy situation
 is the curve for solid solution by itself, either 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{1}$
\end_inset

 on the left or 
\begin_inset Formula $ss_{2}$

The phase diagram toward the middle of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:RegSolPredix"

\end_inset

 (row 3, column 3) can be easily recognized as corresponding to a binary
 isomorphous system, for which the interaction parameters for both solutions
 (liquid, solid) are equal.
 In this case, it is assumed that the interaction parameters are both zero,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ls}=\Omega_{ss}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, both solutions are taken to be ideal or Raoultian.
 Note what happens as we stay in the same column (
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ls}=0)$
\end_inset

 but moving upward, the value of the interaction parameter for the solid
 solution is made progressively more and more positive.
 We obtain the conventional binary eutectic phase diagram, first with limited
 solid solubility (
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ss}=15$
\end_inset

 kJ/mole) and then with negligible solid solubility (
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ss}=$
\end_inset

 30 kJ/mole).
 The behavior at the top-right of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is particularly distinctive.
 This is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 behavior.
 If we dramatically increase the interaction parameter of the liquid solution
 (to +20 or +30 kJ/mole), we can produce phase-separation in the liquid,
 i.e., the coexistence of two liquid solutions.
 Such behavior is employed in the manufacture of a low-cost, high-silica
 glass called Vycor (by the Corning Company).
 Glass bodies are made out of borosilicate glass, which then phase-separates
 into two interconnected phases.
 The one with lower silica content is leached out by acid at room temperature,
 leaving the silica-rich phase, which is then densified at elevated temperature
 into an essentially dense silica body.

 P vs.
 T, chemical potential vs.
 T (both Ellingham-type and log

 However, this is not the case.
 In a T-X binary isomorphous phase diagram the two phases in equilibrium
 at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are liquid solution (prevails at higher temperature) and solid solution
 (prevails at lower temperature).
 In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the two phases in equilibrium are an oxide AO-BO solid solution (prevails
 at higher 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$

\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 The x-axis is the mole fraction of B in either phase, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}/(X_{A}+X_{B})$
\end_inset

, which translates into 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{BO}/(X_{AO}+X_{BO})$
\end_inset

 in the oxide solid solution (see the dual x-axis in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Both solutions are 1) solid and 2) continuous.
 So this is an oxidation phase diagram.

 Since the interpretation of all phase diagrams within a given Type is the

In fact, we can actually simulate the phase diagram in Fig.

 Of course, this is an extremely unique situation, involving continuous
 solid solutions of both phases.
 This would mean that Hume-Rothery rules would need to be satisfied for
 both solid solutions.
 For our simulation, we will assume that both solid solutions behave ideally,
 i.e., they behave according to Raoult's law such that

 is straightforward.
 In each of the single-phase regions there are two degrees of freedom, i.e.,
 to establish thermodynamic equilibrium (in addition to fixing overall pressure
 (1 atm) and temperature (1000K), one would have to fix the overall composition
 (B/A ratio) and the oxygen partial pressure.
 Inside the "lens" however, there is a single degree of freedom.
 If we fix the oxygen partial pressure, both phases' compositions are fixed.
 Alternatively, we need only fix one composition of the two phases in equilibriu
m, say 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{B}$

, and the composition of the other phase,

Type I diagrams are distinctive in their absence of tie-lines.
 Areas are always single-phase regions, and lines are always phase boundaries
 between two adjacent phases.
 Type II diagrams are distinctive because of their having tie-lines perpendicula
r to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

thermodynamic potential
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

) axis.
 The dashed lines are usually not drawn as in the Type II diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TypeCompare"

\end_inset

; but they are understood.
 In fact, since we can always draw another tie-line between any adjacent
 pair of tie-lines, there is an infinite array of tie-lines within the three
 two-phase regions on the diagram.
 However, when these tie-lines converge to unique three-phase (F=O) invariancies
, these are represented as solid lines perpendicular to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

-axis.
 For example, we are quite familiar with the horizontal invariant lines
 in T vs.
 mole fraction eutectic (as in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

) or eutectoid diagrams (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 So there are two different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

areas
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in Type II diagrams: single-phase regions (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

) and two-phase regions consisting of an infinite array of parallel tie-lines
 perpendicular to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

-axis (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+\beta,\alpha+\gamma,\gamma+\beta$
\end_inset

).
 Type III diagrams are distinctive owing to the presence of tie-triangles
 involving three phases in equilibrium (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta,\mathrm{\,and\,}\gamma$
\end_inset

 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 They are also distinctive in that tie-lines need neither be parallel nor
 perpendicular to any axis, as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 In contrast with Type II diagrams, tie-lines for two-phase equilibria are
 typically drawn.
 However, once again since we can always find another tie-line between any
 adjacent pair of tie-lines, so there is an infinite array of tie-lines
 within the two-phase regions on the diagram.
 Furthermore, as these converge to the sides of unique three-phase equilibrium
 triangles, these solid lines become very important, representing the terminal
 compositions of the two phases in equilibrium with that of the third.
 So lines are either phase boundaries of single-phase regions (can be curved)
 or the straight line sides of tie-triangles.
 As can be seen, open 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 These tie-triangles are usually referred to as

The strictly

\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{j}/Q_{k}$
\end_inset

 scheme at the top-left finds limited use in the literature, but can be
 useful for representing phase equilibria in dilute solutions.
 The reason that this representation is not practicable for full-scale diagrams
 has to do with the loci of the end-members B and C on the diagram.
 Component A lies at the origin, however pure B and pure C exist at 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{B}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{C}/n_{A}$
\end_inset

 values of inifinity on their respective axes.
 The mole fraction C vs.
 mole fraction B diagram at the top-right corrects this problem.
 Solutions to the overall mole fraction equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}+X_{B}+X_{C}=1$
\end_inset

, exist only within the dashed region.
 Again, this axis scheme has found limited use in the literature.
 The near-universal axis scheme used by materials scientists and engineers
 involves collapsing the diagram at the upper right of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 into an equilateral triangle as shown in the bottom diagram of the Figure.
 Since this axis scheme was developed by J.
 Willard Gibbs of Gibbs free energy fame, it is usually referred to as a
 Gibbs phase triangle.
 The mole fraction of a given component is read from equally-spaced lines
 drawn parallel to the opposing side of the diagram, as shown for component
 C in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Comparable lines can be drawn parallel to the other two sides of the diagram,
 to establish the mole fractions of components A and B for a specific compositio

\begin_layout Standard
The ternary lever rule is applicable to all tie-triangles, and not just
 equilateral ones.
 The best approach is to employ a ruler to measure the length of line segments
 in the specific triangle.
 For example, take the composition marked by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TernaryLeverRule"

\end_inset

.
 The fraction of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 phase, 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the length of the line segment marked AX divided by the entire length
 of the line drawn from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta-\gamma$
\end_inset

 side of the tie triangle through the overall composition 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 vertex.
 Similarly, the fractions of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 phases can be determined from their relative line lengths, so we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
f^{\alpha}=\frac{AX}{A\alpha}\\
f^{\beta}=\frac{BX}{B\beta}\\
f^{\gamma}=\frac{CX}{C\gamma}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three fractions sum to unity.
 It can be readily seen that when this scheme is applied to an equilateral
 triangle, we obtain the axis scheme associated with Gibbs' phase triangle.

\begin_layout Standard
We can actually produce a schematic liquidus projection diagram based upon
 some thermodynamic data (melting points and enthalpies of melting for the
 end members) and some simple assumptions, namely that there is negligible
 solid solubility and that the liquid solution behaves in a Raoultian fashion.
 These assumptions are not far from reality for many ceramic systems, for
 which fulfillment of the Hume Rothery rules (same crystal structure, same
 cation valence, similar electronegativities, similar cation radii) is fairly
 rare.
 We previously found an equation for the liquidus line in a binary system
 with negligible solid solubility and an ideal liquid (equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NegSS6"

\end_inset

).
 We employed two such equations to establish the two liquidus curves and
 their intersection (the binary eutectic) in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NegSSEutectic"

\end_inset

.
 By combining each of the three possible pairs of equations, we can produce
 the bounding binary eutectic phase diagrams in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Ternary3D"

\end_inset

.
 However, if we assume the ternary liquid solution to be Raoultian, namely
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=X_{i}$
\end_inset

 for each component, there is no reason that the same procedure cannot be
 extended into the ternary diagram.
 First, we write the three equations for each of the three components:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-RT\ln X_{A}(\ell)\simeq\Delta H_{m}(A)\left[1-\frac{T}{T_{m}(A)}\right]\label{eq:NegSS6-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-RT\ln X_{B}(\ell)\simeq\Delta H_{m}(B)\left[1-\frac{T}{T_{m}(B)}\right]\label{eq:NegSS6-2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-RT\ln X_{C}(\ell)\simeq\Delta H_{m}(C)\left[1-\frac{T}{T_{m}(C)}\right]\label{eq:NegSS6-3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

 three equations is outlined in Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
Solutions for each equation are lines parallel to the opposite boundary
 of the phase diagram, i.e., at constant mole fraction of that particular
 component.
 For example, at 900K the solution to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NegSS6-3"

\end_inset

 is a constant mole fraction of C as shown (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{C}=const$
\end_inset

).
 Similarly, at 800K the solution to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NegSS6-1"

\end_inset

 is a constant mole fraction of A as shown (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}=const$
\end_inset

).
 Note that if we keep ramping down the temperature the two solutions meet
 at the temperature of 700K, the binary eutectic temperature for the A-C
 system.
 But the solutions can extend to smaller mole fractions as well.
 This is the genesis of the solid line extending into the interior of the
 phase diagram from the binary eutectic (see solutions for 650K and 600K).
 This would require smaller value of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{C}$
\end_inset

 than at the binary eutectic, where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}+X_{C}=1$
\end_inset

.
 However, this is not a problem since we are now dealing with ternary compositio
ns, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}+X_{B}+X_{C}=1$
\end_inset

.
 We are now following the A plus C plus liquid phase boundary (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valley
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) descending from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pass
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of the A-C binary eutectic into the interior of the phase diagram as in
 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LiqProjPredix"

\end_inset

.
 If we do the same procedure for the A plus B plus liquid phase boundary
 and the B plus C plus liquid phase boundary, the three valleys will meet
 at the ternary eutectic point (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

E
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Ternary3D"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

liquidus projection diagram
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should look something like the bottom diagram in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LiqProjPredix"

\end_inset

.
 There are obvious differences between our predicted phase diagram (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LiqProjPredix"

\end_inset

) and an actual liquidus projection diagram (see Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NaClNaFNaI"

\end_inset

).
 The main difference is that predicted isotherms are straight and parallel
 to one another and parallel to the opposing side of the triangle.
 This is an automatic result of the ideal liquid solution assumption underlyling
 equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NegSS6-1"

\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:NegSS6-3"

\end_inset

.
 In the real phase diagram, although the isotherms are approximately parallel,
 they are curved and deviate substatially from being parallel to the opposing
 side of the triangle.
 This simply makes us challenge our assumptions underlying our predictions.
 First, the liquid solution may be far from Raoultian and second, there
 may actually be appreciable solid solubility.

Hummel's Rules for Ternary Systems with Negligible Solid Solubility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can relax the Raoultian liquid specification in our considerations, but
 if a given ternary phase diagram involves negligible solid solubility it
 can be shown that very specific rules hold for the interpretation of liquidus
 projection diagrams.
 Once we have laid the foundation for interpretation of such Type III phase
 diagrams, we can turn to more sophisticated simulation engines/algorithms
 to help us interpret ternary diagrams with appreciable solid solubility.
 For examples, many metal alloy ternaries fall into the latter category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to introduce Hummel's Rules (adapted from F.
 A.
 Hummel's class notes and his textbook, 
\emph on
Phase Equilibria in Ceramic Systems
\emph default
, Marcel Dekker, 1984), we need to develop a binary analogy.
 We need to think carefully about how to generate both eutectic and peritectic
 behavior in the absence of solid solubility.
 Conventional binary eutectic and peritectic phase diagrams are displayed
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
 We have already described the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

easy melting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character of eutectic systems, but the melting/heating reactions are quite
 different between eutectic and peritectic diagrams.
 We can describe them as follows in equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

In these reactions, the forward arrow stands for heating and the reverse

 From the Greek,

peritectic

 means

covered melting.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This can be seen in that the

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 (the two-phase area where only

 is in equilibrium with liquid) overhangs or covers the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 Another way to describe peritectic melting is that the

 phase melts to a liquid of a different composition and another solid (

 namely the solubility of B in

 and the solubility of A in 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 This works for the eutectic system (as in Fig.

 remind us that thermodynamically speaking, there is no such thing as an

 In contrast, note that it is impossible to preserve peritectic behavior
 when solid solubilities go to zero in a simple binary peritectic diagram
 of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, we can introduce peritectic behavior in a negligible solid solubility
 system by introducing an intermediate compound (AB), as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The diagram on the left has an intermediate compound (AB), which melts
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

congruently,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namely it melts to a liquid of identical composition, AB.
 In fact, we can recognize that this diagram can be thought of as consisting
 of two side-by-side eutectic diagrams: A-AB and AB-B.
 However, this cannot be said of the diagram on the right.
 It similarly has an intermediate compound (AB), however in this case the
 compound (AB) melts 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

incongruently
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to a liquid of a quite different composition (the

 It obeys the peritectic melting behavior described by equation

 in the eutectic-peritectic diagram on the right side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, existing only between the eutectic 
\begin_inset Formula $(e_{1}$
\end_inset

) and peritectic (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

) points.
 The third term, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 requires additional explanation.
 First of all, we need to understand what 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means.
 On the left side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Subsolidus"

\end_inset

 we see a conventional binary eutectic phase diagram with limited solid
 solubility.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solidus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 lines are circled on the left and right and correspond to the first appearance
 of liquid upon heating, or the last occurrence of liquid upon cooling;
 hence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

below the solidus.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, you will see that the horizontal eutectic line is also circled.
 For all compositions between the ends of this line (the extrema of solid
 solubility) the first liquid appears on heating upon crossing this line.
 Conversely, upon cooling the last liquid disappears upon cooling through
 this line.
 Therefore, the horizontal eutectic line can be thought of as part of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solidus.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If we shrink the solid solubilities to essentially zero, we obtain the
 phase diagram on the right side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Subsolidus"

\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 applies to all compositions when below the eutectic temperature.
 We can now introduce two additional terms that are valid for negligible
 solid solubility systems: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility join
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility triangle.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility join
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is any line connecting two phases that are compatible, meaning that they
 do not react to form other phases in the subsolidus.
 In Type III ternary phase diagrams we have both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility joins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

subsolidus compatibility triangles,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the latter referring to composition triangles connecting three compatible
 solid phases in equilibrium in the subsolidus.
 As mentioned previously with regard to the distinctive characteristics
 of the various phase diagram Types in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, compatibility triangles are the hallmark of Type III diagrams.

 Hummel's first rule states that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

liquidus surfaces always fall away (in temperature) from the corresponding
 primary phase.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Thermodynamically, we can understand this from the familiar equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:NegSS6-4-1"

\end_inset

, developed for situations where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 exhibits negligible solid solubility and the liquid solution behaves in
 a Raoultian fashion.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

i
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 stands for the Raoultian liquid host (A, B, AB).
 Starting with the melting temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{m}(i)$
\end_inset

), for which the right side of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is zero, requiring the mole fraction of component 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

i
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in the liquid to be 100%, we can see that as the temperature decreases
 the right side of this equation becomes increasingly positive, requiring
 increasingly fractional mole fractions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

i.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, the liquidus falls away (in temperature and in composition)
 from the corresponding primary phase.
 This can be readily seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

; in both diagrams the liquidus in a given primary phase field always falls
 away from the corresponding primary phase.
 This holds true even for the incongruently melting intermediate compound,
 AB, in the eutectic-peritectic diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

.
 Even though the primary phase field is at some distance from the AB composition
, it can be seen that the liquidus still falls away from the primary phase
 (AB).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hummel's second rule state that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there are as many primary phase fields as there are primary phases that
 melt.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To understand this rule, let's take an imaginary helicopter trip up above
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mount A,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mount B
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mount AB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in each of the diagrams in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

.
 Looking down on each diagram, it is easy to identify three 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mountains
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or primary phase fields, one for A, one for B, and one for AB.
 It is true that we only see a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shoulder
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of mount AB in the eutectic-peritectic diagram on the right of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, the primary phase field is visible for the AB primary phase.
 In each diagram, there are three primary phase fields (PPFs) and three
 primary phases (A, AB, B).
 This may seem overly obvious on these binary diagrams, but this rule will
 be a big help when dealing with ternary liquidus projection diagrams, where
 primary phase fields are areas rather than lines.
 The rule refers to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary phases that melt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for good reason.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Quotes eld

an upper temperature limit of stability,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 namely the compound AB decomposes into solid A and solid B well before
 it has the chance to melt.
 Above the decomposition temperature, it is as if the system is a straightforwar
d A-B eutectic system.
 Believe it or not, it is possible for the compound AB to have a primary
 phase field in a ternary A-B-C system, but this complication is beyond
 the scope of the present treatment; hence the disclaimer referring to

Hummel's third rule states that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a one-to-one correspondence between liquidus invariant points and
 the corresponding subsolidus compatibilities.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 If we go down in temperature into the subsolidus, there are two subsolidus
 compatibilities in each diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, namely A-AB and AB-B.
 In other words, for any composition between A and the intermediate compound,
 AB, in the subsolidus there will be two phases in equilibrium: A and AB.
 Similarly, for any composition between AB and B in the subsolidus, there
 will be two solid phases in equilibrium: AB and B.
 Since there are precisely two subsolidus compatibilities in each diagram,
 from Hummel's third rule we can anticipate two invariant points.
 On the dual-eutectic diagram on the left side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, there is an invariant point where the primary phase fields of A and AB
 meet (
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

) and one where the primary phase fields of AB and B meet (
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 On the eutectic-peritectic diagram to the right side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, there is an invariant point where the primary phase fields of A and AB
 meet (
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1}$
\end_inset

) and one where the primary phase fields of AB and B meet (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

).
 This rule may seem simplistic when dealing with the uncomplicated binary
 diagrams in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, but will be quite powerful when dealing with a complicated ternary liquidus
 projection diagram.
 If there are 10 subsolidus compatibility triangles, there will be precisely
 10 ternary invariant points, with a one-to-one correspondence between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hummel's fourth rule states that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invariant points inside their respective subsolidus compatibilities are
 eutectics, whereas those outside their respective subsolidus compatibilities
 are peritectics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Looking in 2-D at the two phase diagrams in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

, it is quite obvious which points are eutectics and which are peritectics.
 But now imagine that we are back in the helicopter hovering above the 1-D
 phase diagrams (see the lines labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1-D view
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the apparatus beneath each diagram).
 It is clear on the left diagram that the point where the primary phase
 fields of A and AB (PPFs) come together lies within the corresponding A-AB
 subsolidus compatibility (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compats
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the apparatus).
 This is therefore a eutectic.
 The same is true for the eutectic-peritectic diagram on the right side
 of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of the invariant point involving AB and B, the situation is
 different between the two phase diagrams.
 From the helicopter, we can see in the apparatus for the diagram on the
 left side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

 that the point where the primary phase fields of AB and B come together
 lies within the corresponding AB-B subsolidus compatibility; hence, this
 is a eutectic.
 In contrast, the point where the primary phase fields of AB and B come
 together in the diagram on the right side of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BinAnalogs"

\end_inset

 lies outside the corresponding AB-B subsolidus compatibility; hence, this
 is a peritectic.
 Again, these relationships may seem quite simplistic when dealing with
 binary phase diagrams, but rule no.
 4 will be quite powerful when dealing with complex liquidus projection
 diagrams.
 Ternary invariant points inside their corresponding subsolidus compatibility
 triangles will be eutectics; those falling outside their subsolidus compatibili
ty triangles with be peritectics.

It may seem that this diagram is useless in the absence of primary phase
 field labels and liquidus projection isotherms, but application of Hummel's
 rules will show this not to be the case.
 First, let's apply rules no.
 2 and 3: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there are as many primary phase fields as there are primary phases that
 melt
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a one-to-one correspondence between liquidus invariant points and
 the corresponding subsolidus compatibilities.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

primary phases that melt,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 namely the end-members A, B, C, and the binary compound AB.
 In ternary phase space, primary phase fields are areas.
 We can identify four primary phase fields in ternary space.
 We can make assignments beginning from the vertices (end-members) and then
 dealing with any binary and ternary compounds.
 This is done in Fig.

Using the third rule (

\end_inset

there is a one-to-one correspondence between liquidus invariant points and
 the corresponding subsolidus compatibilities
\begin_inset Quotes erd

) we can now sketch in the subsolidus compatibilities.
 There are two ternary invariant points (intersections of three phase boundaries

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as well as intersections of three primary phase fields or

Furthermore, Hummel's rule no.

invariant points inside their respective subsolidus compatibilities are
 eutectics, whereas those outside their respective subsolidus compatibilities
 are peritectics.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 In this case, both invariant points are inside their respective subsolidus
 compatibility triangles; hence, they are both ternary eutectics, as labeled
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In other words, the point where the primary phase fields of A, C, and AB
 converge is inside the corresponding A-C-AB compatibility triangle, and
 similarly for the PPFs of AB, C, and B.

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is much more that can be done with a schematic liquidus projectio

 The fifth rule, in combination with rule no.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

directions of falling temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 on all the liquidus phase boundaries or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

valleys.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 It states, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the direction of falling temperature on a liquid-solid(1)-solid(2) phase
 boundary is always away from the corresponding solid(1)-solid(2) join.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This follows from what we did in predicting liquidus phase boundaries (

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows most of the directions of falling temperature (DFTs) for the current
 ternary phase diagram.
 For example, beginning at the A-C binary eutectic (

\begin_inset Quotes eld

falls away

 The same argument goes for all the

valleys
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 descending into the interior of the phase diagram from the bounding binaries.
 In the middle of the diagram we find a special case, but rule 5 still holds:
 the liquid-solid(C)-solid(AB) phase boundary falls to the left of the AB-C
 join toward one ternary eutectic (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$

 can be sketched.

 the A-AB eutectic temperature is shown as being higher than for the AB-B

 Were you to sketch it in the reverse fashion I could not argue with you,

 However, there is one situation that is forbidden.
 This is shown in Fig.

 This is a violation of Gibbs phase rule.
 For any 2-D phase diagram, Gibbs phase rule is F=3-

 In Fig.

 there are actually five phases in equilibrium: three solid phases (A,AB,B)
 and two liquid solutions (the A-AB eutectic liquid and the AB-B eutectic
 liquid).
 Therefore, such a representation is to be avoided.

The AC-AB binary is a clear solution to Hummel's rule no.
 6 (the Alkemade Theorem).
 Only the liquid-solid(AC)-solid(AB) liquidus boundary crosses the AC-AB
 join.
 Hence, the intersection point is a true binary eutectic (
\begin_inset Formula $e_{6}$
\end_inset

), which is a saddle-point in the liquidus; temperature falls to this point
 along the AC-AB binary (see the figure in the upper right), but falls to
 either side toward the ternary eutectics (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1},E_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 But what about the seemingly corresponding point on the 
\begin_inset Formula $AB-C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join? According to Hummel's rule no.
 1, temperature falls away from the end members on this join, as shown.
 Furthermore, according to Hummel's rule no.
 5, temperature on the liquid-solid(AB)-solid(
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

) phase phase boundary falls away from the AB-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join, as shown.
 However, the AB-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join is NOT a true binary eutectic, owing to the fact that the primary
 phase field of C overlaps the AB-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join at the upper right.
 There is no way on an AB-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 binary eutectic to combine AB and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 and arrive at pure C.
 So the AB-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join is NOT a true binary eutectic phase diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All this results from the peritectic behavior in the C-B binary.
 As shown in the C-B phase diagram, the primary phase field of solid C overhangs
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 composition, requiring that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 melt incongruently to a different solid (C) and a liquid of a different
 composition (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

).
 This behavior persists into the ternary, with the primary phase field of
 C overhanging the liquid-solid(C)-solid(
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

) phase boundary.
 The two circled arrows in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 showing temperature descending from the C-B binary peritectic (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

) to the ternary peritectic (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

) follow from Hummel's rule no.
 5: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the direction of falling temperature on a liquid-solid(1)-solid(2) phase
 boundary is always away from the corresponding solid(1)-solid(2) join.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In this case we have to extend the C-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 subsolidus compatibility join, as shown by the dotted line in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LPno2c"

\end_inset

, away from which the liquid-solid(C)-solid(
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

) boundary descends from the binary peritectic to the ternary peritectic.
 A final clarification has to do with the single arrow along the liquid-solid(AC
)-solid(
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

) liquidus phase boundary, between the ternary peritectic (
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

) and the ternary eutectic (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{3}$
\end_inset

).
 This satisfies Hummel's fifth rule, with the direction of falling temperature
 being away from the corresponding AC-
\begin_inset Formula $C_{2}B$
\end_inset

 join, which is well above it on the diagram.

 Water would be everywhere to the south on the diagram; to the north would
 be the flattened top of mount NaF.
 In the diagram you see dashed tie lines connecting various liquidus composition

 This is a result of negligible solid solubility, namely that little NaCl
 or NaI tends to dissolve in solid NaF.
 All tie-lines radiate from the vertex.

Let's pause and consider the nature of these isothermal sections.
 Later we return to the question of microstructure, however these series
 of diagrams give a good representation of isothermal sections which, once
 again, are true Type III phase diagrams.
 The phase rule for a C=3 system at fixed overall pressure and temperature,
 where C+2 becomes C+0, is given as F=3-
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

.
 Applying this to Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IsoSecNo1d"

\end_inset

, we would find that F=2 in the small liquid solution region (
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

=1); we would have to specify two of the three mole fractions to establish
 equilibrium.
 In the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ice cream cone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 features 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

=2, so we would have one degree of freedom.
 Specifying overall composition determines which tie line we are on, and
 the particular liquid solution in equilibrium with the associated solid
 phase.
 Or given the liquid solution composition, we would know on which tie-line
 the overall composition falls.
 Finally, in each of the tie-triangles 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

=3 making F=0; all of the compositions are fixed, including that of the
 associated liquid solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation is a bit different at the ternary eutectic temperature.
 As we continue to go down in temperature it is apparent that the liquid
 solution region in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is shrinking and approaching the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in our mountain/valley/hole analogy).
 What happens at precisely the point where the altitude of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

hole
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is reached is displayed in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IsoSecNo1e"

\end_inset

.
 At first, this would seem to be a violation of the phase rule (F=3-
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{P}$
\end_inset

), with four phases in equilibrium: solid(NaCl), solid(NaF), solid(NaI),
 and ternary eutectic liquid.
 However, we do not have the luxury of selecting the temperature, in the
 same way that we have no control over the altitude of Jackson Hole.
 The eutectic temperature is fixed for us, meaning that we can only look
 it up in a handbook (or on the published phase diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NaClNaFNaIagain"

\end_inset

).
 We have no ability to change it.
 So (C+2) does not reduce to (C+0) as for the other isothermal sections,
 for which both temperature and pressure is fixed.
 Instead, temperature remains a free variable such that (C+2) becomes (C+1),
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 standing for temperature, and the phase rule becomes F=4-

 So under the unique conditions of a ternary invariant point, we can have
 four phases in equilibrium.

The sequence is particularly simple for the eutectic composition (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{eut}$
\end_inset

).
 Above the liquidus/eutectic we have 100% liquid solution of eutectic compositio
n which, by binary lever rule is 46% B and 54% A.
 Upon cooling through the eutectic reaction, all the eutectic liquid is
 converted to the lamellar eutectic microstructural constituent indicated
 by the banded regions in the bottom diagram on the left of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CrystPathBin"

\end_inset

.
 This layered microstructural constituent results from the growth of layers
 being the most efficient way to separate A and B (by diffusion at the growth
 front) from a solution into separate phases, as shown schematically in
 Fig.

In contrast, the crystallization sequence and liquidus

 for the composition 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

 is quite different.
 Above the liquidus, we have 100% liquid of the composition 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

.
 As we cool below the liquidus the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary phase
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to crystallize from solution is B.
 As B is removed from the liquid solution, the liquid becomes progressively
 richer in A, following the liquidus line as shown, until it reaches the
 eutectic point.
 Since the composition (
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

) is approximately half way between the end-member B and the eutectic compositio
n, at just above the eutectic temperature we would have a microstructure
 with 50% primary B grains and 50% liquid of eutectic composition.
 Now, if we somehow sieved out the primary crystals, what would remain would
 be a liquid of eutectic composition, which would go through the same crystalliz
ation to lamellar eutectic microstructural constituent as happened for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{eut}.$
\end_inset

 The ultimate microstructure would consist of 50% primary B grains suspended
 in 50% lamellar eutectic microstructural constituent, as shown on the bottom-ri

Before considering crystallization sequences/liquidus paths in ternary liquidus-

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namely the ending point of the liquidus path: the ternary invariant point
 where the final liquid disappears in the crystallization sequence.
 Since there is a one-to-one correspondence of subsolidus compatibilities
 and ternary invariant points, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

destination
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will always be the ternary eutectic or peritectic corresponding to the
 subsolidus compatibility in which the overall composition lies.
 In the simple ternary eutectic phase diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In this system, for all compositions within the A-B-C compatibility triangle,

 If we return to the

 analogy, our helicopter has just dropped a skier or snowboarder on the
 liquidus surface at the point marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

X.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Since essentially pure C is crystallizing from the liquid solution, our

path
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (or rather the

 of the liquid) is directly down the mountainside away from the peak, namely
 directly away from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

mount C.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The composition 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was chosen so that its crystallization path would intersect the ternary
 eutectic.
 If we pause just at/above the ternary eutectic, what would be the microstructur
e? We would employ the binary lever rule, since there are only two phases.
 On the line from C through the original composition 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to the eutectic point, the length marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $f_{PriC}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 divided by the entire length of the line would give us the fraction of
 primary C grains in the microstructure (~50%), with the remainder being
 eutectic liquid.
 Once again, if we somehow sieved out the primary crystals, what would remain
 would be a liquid of eutectic composition, which would go through crystallizati
on to ~50% lamellar eutectic microstructural constituent, this time consisting
 of three layers: A plus B plus C.
 If we wanted to know the fractions of phases in the lamellar eutectic,
 we could do the triangular lever rule at the eutectic composition, using
 the entire Gibbs triangle for the calculation.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as shown in the diagram.
 Again, our skier/snowboarder is headed full-tilt down the mountain directly
 away from its peak.
 This time, however, his/her path intersects the solid(C)-solid(A)-liquid
 phase boundary or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

valley.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Just at this point, labeled

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the second microstructure on the right side of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CrysPathTerNo1a"

\end_inset

, we can use the binary lever rule to establish the microstructure.
 The point X' is roughly half way between end-member C and the solid(C)-solid(A)
-liquid boundary.
 This means we have ~50% primary C grains and ~50% liquid of the composition
 at the boundary.
 Here we employ the final dictum of our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

CPD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dicta.
 The letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

D
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

directions of falling temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd

changes in path
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in DPC.
 Quite naturally, the skier/snowboarder carves to the left to follow the
 valley down to the hole.
 What this actually means is that both C and A are crystallizing simultaneously
 from the liquid, the latter as a secondary crystallization product; its
 grains will end up smaller in size than primary phase C grains, owing to
 the fact that they have had less time to nucleate and grow.
 Now let's analyze the situation at a temperature just above the ternary
 eutectic.
 Since we now have three phases in equilibrium, we need to employ the ternary
 lever rule of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TernaryLeverRule"

\end_inset

.
 The analysis is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CrysPathTerNo1c"

\end_inset

.
 A dashed triangle is drawn from end-member C to end-member A and to the
 eutectic composition, on which we carry out the ternary lever rule to establish
 phase fractions.
 Lines from each vertex of this triangle are drawn through the overall compositi
on X'.
 The relative line lengths (divided by the total line lengths) give us the
 fractions of primary C (~65%), secondary A(~16.5%), and eutectic liquid
 (~18.5%).
 As before, if we somehow sieved out both primary and secondary crystals,
 what would remain would be a liquid of eutectic composition, which would
 go through crystallization to lamellar eutectic microstructural constituent.
 The resulting microstructure (~65% primary C, ~16.5% secondary A, ~18.5%
 lamellar eutectic) is shown at the bottom right of Fig.

Of course, very few actual Type III/ternary systems satisfy the assumptions
 we have made thus far (for simplification), namely that the liquid solution
 is everywhere ideal and that there are essentially no solid solutions.
 It should be

\begin_inset Quotes eld

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 ternary systems, in which non-ideality of the liquid solution and significant,
 even substantial, solid solutions can be present.
 However, as we will see, all of the same characteristic features of Type
 III diagrams will be present, namely 1) the presence of tie-triangles,
 2) the occurrence of tie-lines that are neither parallel nor perpendicular
 to any axis, and 3) open areas that can either be tie-triangles or single-phase
 solutions.
 There are, however, important differences.
 In

 Type III isothermal sections, open areas that are not tie-triangles can
 also be solid solution regions in addition to liquid solution regions,

 will morph into quite a variety of quadrilateral constructions, with tie-lines
 connecting compositions on one side (solid solution) to compatible compositions
 on the other side (liquid solutions).

As you can imagine, experimental determination of even one isothermal section
 can be highly time-consuming.
 This has led to the development of and usage of powerful phase diagram
 calculation programs.
 Two of these are FactSage (C.R.C.T., Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal) and Thermo-Ca
lc (Thermo-Calc Software, McMurray, PA; Thermo-Calc Software AB, Stockholm,
 Sweden), but there are many more.
 We will employ Thermo-Calc to calculate both the liquidus and one isotherm
 for the Sn-Pb-Bi phase diagram.
 But the user should be aware that there is a lot that does not

 when using such high-powered

 Behind the scenes, each such program employs a massive database of thermodynami

 cases (not all!) can be far more sophisticated than the dilute solution
 and regular solution models employed in this text.

Things get even more interesting if we do an isothermal section.
 In Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:ThermCalcIsoT2"

\end_inset

 we see the isothermal section predicted by Thermo-Calc at 423.15K (150
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C).
 Note that the low temperature has to do with the relatively low melting
 points (for metals) of Sn (231.9
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C), Pb (327.5
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C), and Bi (271.4
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C).
 Again, at first glance, things seem to be familiar.
 There is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

waffle cone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 structure at the Bi-vertex, where liquid solutions of a wide range of compositi
ons are compatible with/have tie-lines connecting with essentially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bi.
 (But the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ice cream
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems to have melted, i.e., the liquidus boundary is convex.) Also, there
 is one tie-triangle involving Sn-solid solution, Pb-solid solution, and
 liquid solution (ls).
 But elsewhere this isothermal section is quite different from what we have
 seen thus far.
 There are significant solubilities in both solid Sn (Bi is much more soluble
 than Pb) and in solid Pb (both Sn and Bi are quite soluble, with Bi being
 roughly twice as soluble as Sn).
 We also see a small solid solubility range for an intermediate compound
 in the Pb-Bi system.
 If we look at the Pb-Bi phase diagram (not shown) we find out that the
 intermediate compound is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-Pb.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It is apparent in the isothermal section of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-Pb dissolves a considerable amount of Sn, but to determine the amount of
 excess Bi or Pb it dissolves, we would have to consult the binary diagram
 to ascertain the 150
\begin_inset Formula $^{o}$
\end_inset

C values in comparison with its nominal Bi/Pb stoichiometry.
 Anyway, this explains the four primary phase fields and the two ternary
 invariant points in the liquidus diagram of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, the biggest differences in the isothermal section of Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are the regions of tie-lines connecting various phases in equilibrium.
 These turn out to be strangely-shaped quadrilateral constructions bearing

 Type III systems (non-ideal liquid solution, non-negligible solid solutions)
 and the constrained Type III systems (ideal liquid solution, negligible
 solid solutions) we have studied thus far has to do with crystallization
 sequences/liquidus paths and microstructure evolution.
 For example, in a two-phase equilibrium region, the compositions of the
 solutions at the end of tie-lines through a fixed overall composition change
 with temperature.
 Think of the overall composition as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 From above, the resulting two paths, e.g., of liquid solution and of solid

X
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is cooled to the liquidus, the first solid 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 to precipitate from solution has a fairly high A-content, as shown.
 However, at a much lower temperature, the equilibrium solid 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 phase will have a significantly smaller A-content, if equilibrium were
 maintained.
 The problem is that alloys are seldom cooled at rates slow enough to maintain
 equilibrium.
 That is because, once precipitated out, a solid phase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locks up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 its constituents, since diffusion in solids is so much slower than in liquids.
 So what happens is that the new 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'$
\end_inset

 precipitating out will do so at a more B-rich composition.
 In the schematic microstructure beneath the two phase diagrams this is
 represented as a distinct layer of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'$
\end_inset

 around a core of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 In reality, there will be a gradual shift in composition from the center
 outward and, in fact, this will occur by dendritic growth.
 You will learn about dendrites and dendritic growth in later materials
 science and engineering coursework.
 For now, we need only point out that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solid composition (averaging the composition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha'$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha''$
\end_inset

, etc.) deviates from the solidus line.
 Since less A is being removed from the liquid, the liquidus trajectory
 must also therefore deviate from the equilibrium liquidus, as shown.
 All this is beyond the scope of the present text, but gives you a good
 idea of what you can look forward to in upcoming microstructure-evolution
 coursework.
 The conclusion of this discussion is that crystallization sequences/liquidus
 paths in

Another technologically important application is that of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

solders.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A solder is a fusible alloy of two or more metals used to join metal parts
 together and having a melting point lower than those of the constituents
 or of the parts being joined.
 Solders are commonly used in plumbing, sheet metal joining, and electronics.
 The application in electronics is of particular importance, since solder
 is employed for making permanent mechanical and electrical connection of
 parts to the printed circuit boards on which they are mounted.
 Eutectic compositions are of special interest owing to the low melting
 points and absence of any primary phase that could disrupt electrical contact,
 for example if the joint solidifies in the so-called “pasty” (eutectic
 liquid plus primary phase) state.
 For decades, the alloy of choice for electrical soldering was 60/40 Sn/Pb.
 This is because the eutectic composition in the Sn-Pb system is 63% Sn
 and 37% Pb, which melts at the lowest possible (eutectic) temperature of
 
\begin_inset Formula $188^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the Sn/Pb ratio is closer to 50/50 in plumbing solder,
 so chosen because this alloy solidifies more slowly and manageably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years, however, environmental safety concerns have motivated a
 steady move away from Pb-based solders owing to the recognized toxicity
 of Pb in both manufacturing and recycling.
 In the European Union, directives issued in 2006 prohibited the inclusion
 of significant Pb contents in consumer electronics.
 In the U.S., there are also tax incentives for the reduction of Pb content
 in consumer electronics.
 There are many binary and ternary (largely eutectic) systems that have
 been investigated and employed as Pb-free solders.
 One of the most commercially successful solders to date comes from the
 Sn-Ag-Cu ternary system shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NISTSnAgCuLP"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, the eutectic in question is where the primary phase fields
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Sn$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Ag_{3}Sn$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Cu_{3}Sn$
\end_inset

 come together, which is very near the Sn-vertex and therefore extremely
 difficult to see on the full ternary.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NISTSnAgCuCorner"

\end_inset

 is a blow-up of the Sn-corner showing the low-melting eutectic composition
 of approximately 4 mass% silver and 1 mass% copper (~95 mass% Sn) at 
\begin_inset Formula $218^{o}C$
\end_inset

.
 It seems appropriate to conclude our discussion of ternary phase diagrams
 with a true Type III or 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}/Q_{k}$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{j}/Q_{k}$

Fick's Laws of Diffusion

Just as there are fundamental laws governing the thermodynamics of materials,
 so there are basic laws governing diffusion or how atoms/ions move around
 in materials.

\begin_layout Standard
By isotropic, we mean that the diffusion rate of an impurity atom is independent
 of direction.
 The planes are separated by the distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,$
\end_inset

 which we will refer to as the jump distance.
 Each plane has a different areal density of impurity atoms (# per 
\begin_inset Formula $cm^{2}$
\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 on plane 1 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 on plane 2.
 Things are simplified by assuming an isotropic solid, since we can consider
 jumps from plane 1 to plane 2 (along the +
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis) to be only one of six possible jump directions (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm x,\pm y,\pm z$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the number of atoms jumping from plane 1 to plane 2 during a
 time period 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta t$
\end_inset

 will be equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

where

Two immediate observations can be made from Eq.

 The units of flux are 
\begin_inset Formula $(\#/cm^{2})/s$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, if the area concentration of the impurity is the same on the
 two planes, the net flux will be zero.
 However, this does not indicate a static situation; it only means that
 the flux to the right (
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}=\frac{1}{6}\varGamma n_{1}$
\end_inset

) is the same as the flux to the left (
\begin_inset Formula $J_{2}=\frac{1}{6}\varGamma n_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 In fact, each of these fluxes can be enormous.
 Net zero flux only requires that their magnitudes be the same, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $J=J_{1}-J_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 We can convert to volume concentrations in Figure

This important equation tells us that the flux is proportional to the negative

where D is the isotropic diffusion coefficient.
 Since the jump frequency (

\begin_inset Formula $\#/s$
\end_inset

 and the jump distance (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 Many times we will see diffusion coefficients in other units, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}/s$

Wow! An average interstitial carbon atom makes approximately 2.2 billion
 jumps in just one second at this temperature! Yet the lattice vibrational
 frequency (recall the Debye frequency from your thermodynamics background,

\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}/s$

 We can look at this frequency as the

It is also of interest to compare how far an average interstitial atom moves
 from its initial position in one second vs.
 the total distance of back-and-forth motions it makes in that same second.

The circle with the dot represents a jump out of the plane of the diagram

 It can be seen that many of the jumps are ineffective for long-range diffusion,

 Nevertheless, the interstitial atom makes steady progress away from its
 initial position, and the dashed line connects the initial position with
 the final position after all the jumps are considered.

It has been found that hydrogen dissolves to some extent in steel, maintaining
 a constant surface composition on the inner surface of the tank that depends
 upon the tank pressure.
 Since air surrounds the tank and the hydrogen content in air at ground
 level is less than 1 part per million, we can assume the hydrogen content
 on the outside of the tank to be zero.
 Let the equilibrium hydrogen content on the inner surface be 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{H}$
\end_inset

 and the wall thickness be 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 A steady state situation means that the hydrogen content decreases linearly
 with distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{H}$
\end_inset

 at the inner wall to zero at the outer wall (
\begin_inset Formula $x=\xi$
\end_inset

The product 
\begin_inset Formula $D\cdot c_{H}$
\end_inset

 is often called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

gas permeability,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 since to be permeable through the solid wall the gas has to be both soluble
 (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{H}$
\end_inset

) and mobile (
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

).
 Gas permeability is given in units of 
\begin_inset Formula $g/cm\cdot s$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $kg/m\cdot s$
\end_inset

, which reflects the product of the diffusion coefficient (
\begin_inset Formula $cm^{2}/s$

\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}/s$
\end_inset

) and the appropriate mass concentration (
\begin_inset Formula $g/cm^{3}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $kg/m^{3}$
\end_inset

).
 Fortunately, the gas permeability of hydrogen through steel is relatively
 small at room temperature.
 Nevertheless, given sufficient time and sufficient diffusion the internal
 gas pressure (and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{H}$
\end_inset

) will gradually decline to yet another steady state situation.
 A compelling demonstration of this effect is the loss of helium from mylar
 balloons.
 Helium rapidly diffuses through typical rubber balloons.
 However, mylar balloons have a thin aluminum metal coating that helps to
 slow down helium diffusion.
 Nevertheless, helium eventually escapes causing the balloon to slowly lose
 buoyancy.

 In virtually all other instances of diffusion, the impurity concentration

 For such situations we will need another diffusion law, referred to as

 Consider the two concentration profiles in Figure

Fick's First Law in equation

 tells us that the flux is proportional to the negative of the concentration
 gradient at each point.
 Based upon the gradient (slope) at each plane, it can be seen that the
 flux across plane 1 is greater than the flux across plane 2 in the concave-up
 
\begin_inset Formula $c$

\begin_inset Formula $x$

 We might therefore expect the local concentration between the planes to
 increase with time in the first situation, but decrease with time in the
 second.
 To simplify our discussion, let's assume that the flux is a linear function

 As can be seen, the flux into the volume between the planes is greater

 volume to increase with time.
 If we specify an identical area, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 added to the volume between the two planes during an increment of time,

Since the units of flux are

 between the planes.
 Since the volume in question is just the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta x$
\end_inset

 We can use equation

This is the most general form of Fick's Second Law, which holds for all

 not change significantly with position.
 This simplifies things considerably.

This equation tells us that the rate of change of concentration at a given

 a specific concentration profile, and 2) to test whether specific diffusion

Again, fortunately, the first term dominates, and for average compositions

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is very useful for describing the degassing of metals, including decarburizatio
n of steels.
 In this case the diffusion coefficient in the relaxation time would be
 that of the particular gas species or of carbon in the particular metal.
 Another application involves the relaxation of vacancies in a supersaturated
 metal, for example a metal quenched from high temperature has a large vacancy
 population.
 If the metal is taken to an intermediate temperature where the equilibrium
 vacancy concentration is small (effectively zero compared to the quenched-in
 concentration, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{o}$
\end_inset

) and vacancies are sufficiently mobile that they can annihilate at sinks
 such as dislocation cores or grain boundaries, relaxation will occur.
 The situation involving dislocation cores is represented schematically

 initial, quenched-in concentration,

 In this case,

 would be the average dislocation spacing and the diffusion coefficient
 would be that of vacancies in the metal of interest.

Thin Film Tracer Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thin film 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tracer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 diffusion is of special importance to materials science and engineering.
 It is how diffusion coefficients are often measured.
 Imagine a thin film containing an area concentration (
\begin_inset Formula $\#/cm^{2}$
\end_inset

) of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tracer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is deposited on a highly polished, flat surface of a single crystal
 (crystal #1 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TracerDiff"

\end_inset

).
 To prevent any loss of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tracer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (for example by evaporation) and also to provide a second crystal in which
 to study diffusion, the highly polished, flat surface of crystal #2 in
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TracerDiff"

\end_inset

 is butted up against crystal #1, sandwiching the tracer thin film between
 them.
 For self-diffusion studies, the tracer is the same chemical species as
 constitutes both crystals, however with a different atomic mass (namely,
 another isotope than that of the host atoms making up the two crystals).
 In many instances, a radioactive tracer is employed at low concentrations
 (and low radioactive emission levels to protect lab workers).
 In this case, the relative concentration of tracer at a specific diffusion
 depth is determined by the number of radioactive 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

counts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 registered at that depth, usually by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

serial sectioning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see below).
 In other cases, the amount of a non-radioactive tracer diffused to a given
 depth can be established by the use of a mass spectrometer that can differentia
te and quantify the relative amounts of tracer species vs.
 naturally occurring (host crystal) species.

 to room temperature as quickly as possible.
 For ceramic samples, heating and cooling rates are limited by what the

 Alternatively, the count rate (counts/time) can be measured by a radiation

 The count rate will be directly proportional to the concentration in each

 The increment of depth can be measured directly by a high precision micro-calip

 Alternatively, it can be indirectly calculated from the mass removed, which
 can be measured quite accurately.
 In the case of non-radioactive tracers, mass spectrometry is employed to
 calculate the tracer content in a given section.

\begin_layout Standard
As opposed to thin film tracer diffusion, where the

surface

 composition diminishes with time, there are a number of situations in materials
 science and engineering where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

surface
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 composition is maintained constant with time.
 These include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

doping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 situations, where a solid is held in an atmosphere that keeps the composition
 of an impurity at a constant level on the exposed surface.
 Similarly, the carburization of iron or steel can be controlled by holding
 the surface in an atmosphere with a fixed ratio of carbon monoxide and
 carbon dioxide.
 The amount of carbon in solution at the surface is thereby fixed according
 to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
2CO(gas)\Leftrightarrow CO_{2}(gas)+\bar{C}(insolution)\label{eq:carburization}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As carbon diffuses into the interior of the solid, the above reaction guarantees
 that additional carbon is added to the surface to maintain the surface
 carbon composition.
 The overall impurity (or carbon) content of the solid is given by equation

\begin_layout Standard
where A is the area of the surface into which solute is diffusing.
 This means, of course, that as opposed to thin film tracer diffusion, the
 overall solute content steadily increases with time.
 This is shown schematically on the left side of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{o}$

 is the initial carbon content and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$

 is the surface composition.
 The concentration profile moves progressively to the right with time, as
 the interior of the solid is progressively enriched with solute.
 We later consider how thick the sample must be to be

Before we introduce the solution to Fick's Second Law that meets the boundary

 does not vary with impurity content, and therefore distance from the surface
 (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

).
 This is valid for the doping of semiconductors from gas phase precursors,
 where relatively small dopant levels are involved.
 However, in the case of carburization, relatively large changes in solute
 (carbon) content occur and the diffusion coefficient is known to vary somewhat
 with carbon composition (and therefore position) along the diffusion profile.
 Fortunately, relatively good predictions of carbon diffusion profiles can

It turns out that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that has an error function value of 0.5 is very close to 0.5 (see the error
 function Table or Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ErfAndEfrcPlot"

\end_inset

), or more precisely 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x/\sqrt{Dt}=0.477$
\end_inset

.
 If we let 
\begin_inset Formula $z\approx0.5$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0.5}\approx\sqrt{Dt}$
\end_inset

.
 This distance of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It is a useful 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metric
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for diffusion in situations involving constant surface composition.
 For example, one might ask, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How much longer must I diffuse at the same temperature to double the diffusion
 depth?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The answer follows from the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0.5}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DblDepthQuadTime"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{x_{0.5}^{'}}{x_{0.5}}=2=\frac{\sqrt{Dt^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{Dt}}=\sqrt{\frac{t^{\prime}}{t}};\frac{t^{\prime}}{t}=4\label{eq:DblDepthQuadTime}

or four times the length of time.
 We can also establish the thickness of sample required to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semi-infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with respect to a given combination of diffusion coefficient and time.
 From the previous Table of error function values, we can observe that at
 
\begin_inset Formula $z=x/\sqrt{Dt}=2$
\end_inset

 the diffusion profile has diminished by 99.5% toward the original composition.
 In other words, very little (0.5%) impurity has been delivered at this point
 in the diffusion profile.
 For diffusion from one side, a specimen must therefore be greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{Dt},$
\end_inset

 or twice the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion depth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For diffusion from both sides of a plate we might define 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semi-infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as being 
\begin_inset Formula $>4\sqrt{Dt}$
\end_inset

 or roughly four times the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion depth.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Of course, this is arbitrary and more stringent definitions of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semi-infinite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be made (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2.5$
\end_inset

, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $erf(z)=0.9996$
\end_inset

).
 For diffusion from both sides of a plate, this would amount to 0.08% added
 impurity at the middle of the specimen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, we should not forget our non-infinite solutions to Fick's Second
 Law, which are required in place of error function (semi-infinite) solutions
 when there is significant overlap of diffusion profiles from the two sides
 of a plate.
 Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 composition) for the plate.
 We revisit such overlap when we consider decarburization (below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the solutions that follow are simply permutations of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:erfCarb2level2"

\end_inset

.
 For instance, let's consider carburization or doping of an initially 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 host.
 Of course, from thermodynamics we know that there is no such thing as complete
 purity.
 Impurities, including the one we are interested in, are always present
 to some degree.
 However, their level can be considered so inconsequential as to be effectively
 zero, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{o}$
\end_inset

 can be taken to be zero in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 By making this assumption and rearranging, we obtain equation

Now let's consider decarburizing, which is the opposite of carburizing (adding
 carbon to iron or steel).
 On the left side of Figure C, we are holding the surface carbon content
 at a lower value than the initial carbon content of the specimen.
 This can be accomplished by employing appropriate carbon monoxide/carbon
 dioxide gas ratios, as per equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:carburization"

\end_inset

 As time proceeds, carbon is removed by diffusion from progressively larger
 depths.
 Keep in mind, however, that the specimen is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semi-infinite,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namely that its width is at least 2 diffusion depths (or 4 diffusion depths
 if decarburized from both sides).

 solution for the boundary conditions applied.
 It should once again be stressed that the sample must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

semi-infinite,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namely if being decarburized from both sides it should be several (>4)

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in width, such that there is no overlap of error function solutions at
 the middle of the sample.
 If there is considerable overlap, we once again turn to our non-infinite
 solutions.
 These take into account both the carbon contents vs.
 position (equation

Before considering the special case of interdiffusion, let's introduce some
 practical uses for all the error function solutions considered thus far.
 For many years, the n-type and p-type regions of microelectronic circuits
 were made by exposing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semiconductor-grade
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (ultra-high purity) silicon wafers to gases containing n-type dopants or
 p-type dopants through removable masks in a process called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

photolithography.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Although diffusion is sometimes still used, for instance to set the background
 impurity level of a silicon layer, nowadays doping is usually accomplished
 by ion-implantation of dopants owing to improved controllability and speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Carburization and decarburization are fundamental to the processing of steels
 and for the preparation of their surfaces.
 For example, carburization is well known to increase the hardness of steels.
 In the case of a machine gear, for instance, the materials engineer may
 be interested in maintaining different properties of the gear core (high
 strength with toughness) and the gear surface (high strength with hardness).
 This calls for a different carbon content in the core vs.
 on its surface.
 In particular, carburization is employed to boost the carbon content at
 the surface, making it hard and wear-resistant.
 This can be done by a process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pack carburization,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 namely packing the gear in a high temperature bed of charcoal, often referred
 to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

case hardening.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, carburization is more often accomplished by exposing steel surfaces
 to carbon-containing gases (see equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:carburization"

\end_inset

) or to carbon-containing plasmas.
\end_layout

 It should be stressed that for the error function solution to be employed,

 With these qualifications, the mid-point of the diffusion profile, both
 in terms of composition and in terms of distance, remains stationary with
 time as shown in Figure

 It can be seen that the composition at this point remains the average of

Before moving on, it should be stressed that interdiffusion with an essentially
 composition-independent and therefore position-independent diffusion coefficien
t is rather the exception than the rule.
 Most interdiffusion problems involve 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interdiffusion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 coefficients that are clearly functions of concentration and therefore
 of position.
 In an A:B couple, where A and B are different metals, the usual case is
 for A to diffuse faster into B or vice versa.
 In fact, the point of average composition, 
\begin_inset Formula $(c_{1}+c_{2})/2$
\end_inset

, moves with diffusion time.
 Fortunately, procedures exist to solve interdiffusion profiles for composition-
dependent diffusion coefficients at each point.
 You will learn about these methods in lab projects and in upper level materials
 science and engineering coursework.

in Box G, which tells us that three groupings of factors govern each individual
 diffusion mechanism: a geometric factor (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

), and entropic factor (
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

), and a thermally-activated term (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{act}$
\end_inset

).
 Let's get started by considering the most straightforward of diffusion
 mechanisms, interstitial diffusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interstitial Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although self-diffusion by interstitials is possible in certain ceramic
 materials, we will restrict our consideration to impurity diffusion where
 the impurity spends all of its time in the interstices of the crystal lattice.
 A good example is carbon diffusion in iron.
 This type of impurity diffusion has special requirements, namely that 1)
 the atomic radius of the impurity is significantly less than that of the
 host (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{C}<r_{Fe}$
\end_inset

), and 2) the atomic radius of the impurity is comparable to that of the
 interstices.
 It should be stressed that self-diffusion in close-packed metals never
 takes place by interstitial diffusion.
 The radius of a host atom is far too great for it to squeeze into the much
 smaller interstices in between host atoms.
 To place a host atom into such an interstice would be highly unfavorable
 energetically; self-interstitials are therefore highly unlikely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's begin to analyze interstitial diffusion using the modular plug-in
 chart in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DiffPlugIns"

\end_inset

.
 Since the interstitial is always an interstitial, there is no thermal activatio
n process associated with its formation as in Box D.
 Furthermore, the availability factor for interstitial jumps can be assumed
 to be essentially unity (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{int}\approx1$
\end_inset

), namely adjacent interstitial sites into which the interstitial can jump
 can be assumed to be empty.
 Of course, at the highest carbon contents there is a finite possibility
 that an adjacent interstitial is occupied.
 We could express the availability factor as (
\begin_inset Formula $1-X_{i}$
\end_inset

), where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the site fraction of carbon interstitials.
 But for simplicity we will assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\ll1$
\end_inset

 and assume an availability factor (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{int}$
\end_inset

) of unity.

 These have to do with the defect jump frequency in Box C of Figure

 In moving from one interstitial site to another, a certain amount of lattice

 The energy landscape is shaped like a saddle.
 Alternately, you can think about a mountain pass.
 You go up and over the pass, but when you are at the top of the pass you
 find the land rising to either side.
 From statistical mechanics, the probability that an interstitial has sufficient
 energy to reach the saddle point is small.
 It is governed by the height of the pass (
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta G_{m}$
\end_inset

) and the temperature.
 Higher temperature means more energy being available to the interstitials,
 and an increasing fraction of them having the probability to make it to/past
 the saddle point.
 The relationship is given by equation

It should be apparent that an interstitial at the saddle point has a different

\begin_layout Standard
Let's first unpack the underlying parameters in the geometric factor (
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

).
 We already know that the attempt frequency (

\end_inset

 But the jump distance (

 It is obvious that the two sets of lattice positions (host atoms, interstices)
 form interpenetrating fcc lattices.
 In fact, we will encounter interpenetrating lattices when we consider the

 sit on the other.
 In austenite, most of the second interpenetrating (interstitial) lattice
 is empty.
 However, the fact that it (the interstitial lattice) is also fcc is quite
 important.
 It means that the coordination number of empty interstitials sites around
 any given occupied interstitial site will be the same as the coordination
 number of neighboring iron atoms around any given iron host atom.
 This gives us the value we need for the coordination number in 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

Before we make a comparison with experimental values, it must be stressed
 that owing to the larger interstice size in fcc iron vs.
 bcc iron, the former (austenite) can incorporate a much larger carbon content
 than the latter (ferrite).
 We mentioned previously that the diffusion of carbon in fcc iron was not
 a constant, but rather varied measurably with carbon content.
 Fortunately, the variation is not extreme and a practicable composition-indepen
dent approximation appears in most diffusion textbooks.
 This approximation is given by the following equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Given our rather simplistic assumptions and the fact that the experimental
 equation is itself an approximation, the agreement of pre-exponential values
 (estimated: 
\begin_inset Formula $0.38\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/s}$

Let's see how we do estimating the geometric factor and pre-exponent for
 carbon diffusion in the bcc (ferrite) form of iron.
 Interestingly, the interstices in bcc iron exist only on the faces of the
 unit cell as shown on the right side of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CarbonJumpAustFerr"

\end_inset

.
 These interstices are found along the edges and at the face centers of
 the unit cell.
 As a result, the jump distance is half of the cube edge or lattice parameter,
 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=a_{o}/2=0.29nm/2=0.14nm$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are no bcc interstices within the unit cell, the coordination
 number can be determined by looking at the face-centered interstice on
 any face in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 If occupied, it is surrounded by 4 empty interstices at the 4 cube edge
 positions, so 
\begin_inset Formula $z=4$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming once again an attempt frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{13}/s$

Vacancy Diffusion

\begin_layout Standard
Self-diffusion or impurity-diffusion by vacancy mechanism can be likened
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tile
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 puzzles we have handled physically or solved as a computer game.
 Consider the tile puzzle in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:VacPuzzle"

\end_inset

.
 The configuration on the top left is insoluble owing to the absence of
 a vacancy, whereas the configuration on the top right is soluble by virtue
 of the vacancy's presence.
 The analogy to solids is that without such defects, there can be no diffusion
 and thus no reactivity.
 This is further illustrated in the bottom diagrams of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:VacPuzzle"

\end_inset

, each illustrating a close-packed plane in either hcp or fcc solids.
 With the addition of the vacancy in the bottom-right configuration, it
 is obvious that self diffusion of the atom to the left of the vacancy takes
 place by exchange with the vacancy.
 By moving the vacancy all around the lattice, each atom will eventually
 have its turn to exchange with the vacancy.
 From the outset, we might guess that the vacancy diffusivity will be much
 larger than that of the host or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

self

 atoms; the self-diffusion coefficient will be much smaller than the vacancy
 diffusion coefficient.

Substitutional impurities, namely those that sit on host atom sites rather
 than in its interstices, also depend upon vacancy motion for diffusion
 to take place.
 The shaded atom in the bottom-right configuration in Figure Z represents
 such a substitutional impurity.
 It is obvious that for this to take place, the atomic radius of the impurity
 must be comparable to that of the host.
 Impurity atoms will similarly bide their time waiting to exchange with
 a host vacancy that comes their way.
 They may exchange more readily or less so than the host atoms, but both

\begin_inset Formula $D_{v}/D_{A}$

 by solving a

Now let's estimate a range of pre-exponential factors for self-diffusion
 in fcc metals based upon our best guess of atomistic factors.
 We will assume a representative value for the jump distance in equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SelfDiffOverall"

\end_inset

 of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3nm$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3x10^{-7}cm$
\end_inset

.
 For example, recall that we obtained 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.26nm$
\end_inset

 for fcc iron.
 We also established that the coordination number (
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

) of adjacent sites around any given host atom, on which a vacancy might
 sit, is 12.
 Again, we will assume the familiar value for the attempt frequency (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10^{13}/s$
\end_inset

.
 Theorists find values for both the entropy of formation and motion to be
 on the order of R, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(\varDelta S/R)\sim2.7$
\end_inset

, however a range of values is found in the literature.
 We will employ a range of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\lesssim\exp(\varDelta S_{v})\lesssim10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\lesssim\exp(\varDelta S_{mv})\lesssim10$
\end_inset

 .
 Plugging all these values into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SelfDiffOverall"

\end_inset

, we obtain a range of pre-exponent values of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.018cm^{2}/s\lesssim D_{Ao}\lesssim1.8cm^{2}/s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So how did we do? The pre-exponential factors for self diffusion are 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7cm^{2}/s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1.9cm^{2}/s$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.30cm^{2}/s$
\end_inset

 for fcc aluminum, nickel, and copper, respectively 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Given all the assumptions we made, the agreement is quite good.

\begin_layout Standard
What about self-diffusion in bcc metals? Again, let's assume a representative
 value for the jump distance in equation of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3nm$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3x10^{-7}cm$
\end_inset

.
 As opposed to fcc metals, the jump distance is different for site-to-site
 jumps vs.
 interstitial-to-interstitial jumps.
 This is demonstrated in the bcc structure of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bccJump"

\end_inset

, where the near-neighbor jump is one-half the body diagonal, or 
\begin_inset Formula $(\sqrt{3}a_{o})/2$
\end_inset

.
 In bcc iron, this jump distance would be 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25nm$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $.25x10^{-7}cm$
\end_inset

.
 From the same Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:bccJump"

\end_inset

, the coordination number is obviously 8 as opposed to 12 for fcc metals.
 Again, assuming a typical attempt frequency (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

) of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{13}/s$
\end_inset

 and a range of entropic factors, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $1\lesssim\exp(\varDelta S_{v})\lesssim10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1\lesssim\exp(\varDelta S_{mv})\lesssim10$
\end_inset

, and inserting these values into the first bracket of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we obtain as an estimate, 
\begin_inset Formula $0.012cm^{2}/s\lesssim D_{Ao}\lesssim1.2cm^{2}/s$

\begin_layout Subsection
Interstitialcy Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the three diffusion mechanisms we have thus far considered, interstitialcy
 diffusion is certainly the most unusual.
 The German word for this mechanism is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zwischengitterstossmechanismus,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which does a far better job conveying the concept.
 The words that make up this moniker will help us understand its meaning.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gitter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to the normal lattice sites.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zwischen
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

between.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 And the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stoss
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shove.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This mechanism is exclusive to compounds with more than one sublattice.
 This is because the interstice size in metals is never big enough to accommodat
e a self-interstitial.
 However, in certain ceramic materials one species, for example the electroposit
ive cations, can be much smaller than the electronegative anions.
 And in this case the cation interstices can be large enough to accommodate
 cation self-interstitials.
 The classic example is AgBr, which readily forms Ag self-interstitials.
 But rather than moving around by interstitial mechanism, as carbon does
 in iron, a coordinated two-cation motion mechanism takes place, in which
 an interstitial cation bumps another cation off its normal site and takes
 its place.
 That's where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shove
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 part of zwischengitterstossmechanismus comes in.
 The normal cation now becomes an interstitial cation, and the process continues.
 A schematic the first step of such a process in AgBr is shown in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
I like to think of one of two analogies for interstitialcy mechanism.
 The first involves 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sending
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an opponent's ball in croquet.
 Once I touch your ball with mine, I have the option of positioning my ball
 under my foot right next to yours and then clobbering my ball, the transferred
 momentum sending your ball way off course.
 The other analogy involves shuffleboard (or curling, if you have ever seen
 it), where the momentum of my puck/stone is transferred to your puck, which
 (hopefully) is removed from the scoring area while mine takes its place.
 Two points need to be made about the interstitialcy event.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IntcyJump"

\end_inset

, the process is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

collinear,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning that the pushed atom moves along the same line as the pushing atom.
 This need not be the case, as we well know from the shuffleboard/curling
 analogy.
 Non-collinear interstitialcy mechanisms are definitely known to occur.
 Second, note that the interstitial has moved twice as far as the host atom
 that got pushed.
 This may not seem significant, but it is actually one way to confirm that
 the collinear interstitialcy mechanism is occurring.
 Later we will find out how to use electrical conductivity to establish
 the diffusivity by charged ions, so-called ionic diffusivity/conductivity.
 It turns out that when we measure the diffusivity of silver ions by tracer
 methods in AgBr, we get an answer that is approximately half the diffusivity
 of silver ions measured by electrical conductivity.
 Why is this? Look again at Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IntcyJump"

\end_inset

.
 The charge (the interstitial) is moving twice as far as the shaded host
 ion (which could be a tracer ion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the complexity of the interstitialcy mechanism and the relative dearth
 of representative pre-exponential factors, we will not subject this mechanism
 to the intense atomistic scrutiny as we did for interstitial and vacancy
 mechanisms.
 However, we can make some remarks about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jump frequency
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defect availability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Box B of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DiffPlugIns"

\end_inset

.
 It makes sense that the interstitialcy defects are jumping with a frequency,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varGamma_{iy}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $"iy"$
\end_inset

 for interstitialcy).
 But if I am a silver cation on a host site, instead of waiting for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pullers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to come along (vacancies), I am now biding my time awaiting the arrival
 of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pusher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to come along (interstitialcy defects) and knock me on my way.
 Hence the defect availability factor will be the fraction of occupied interstic
es, or 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{iy}$
\end_inset

.
 By analogy with the vacancy mechanism, the corresponding Box E interstitialcy
 diffusion coefficient (with direct analogy to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SelfDiffOverall"

\end_inset

) is equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
As with the vacancy mechanism, this equation has geometric (

\begin_layout Subsection
The Arrhenius Behavior of Diffusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that for all diffusion mechanisms considered thus far, Arrhenius
 behavior results, namely that the diffusion coefficient is thermally activated
 as per the equation in Box F of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DiffPlugIns"

\end_inset

.
 We already saw this behavior for tracer diffusion in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:TracerDiff"

\end_inset

 and for general diffusion in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:BasicDiff"

\end_inset

, which is repeated here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D=D_{o}\exp\left(\frac{-Q}{RT}\right)\label{eq:BasicDiff-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As materials scientists and engineers, we need to be confident in using
 and manipulating diffusion data that behave in this Arrhenius, thermally-activa
ted fashion.
 Here are some things we need to be able to do: 1) plot experimental data
 for diffusion on a 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln D$
\end_inset

 vs inverse temperature (T
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

) plot to extract pre-exponent and activation energy, 2) given the pre-exponent
 and activation energy for diffusion, calculate the diffusion coefficient
 for a specified temperature, or make the corresponding Arrhenius plot of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln D$
\end_inset

 vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{-1}$
\end_inset

, 3) given the diffusion coefficient at one temperature and the activation
 energy, predict the diffusion coefficient at another temperature, or 4)
 given diffusion coefficients at two temperatures, be able to extract pre-expone
ntial factor and activation energy, plus predict the diffusion coefficient
 at an intermediate temperature.
 All of these tasks are quite straightforward once we recognize that taking
 the logarithm of both sides of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:BasicDiff-1"

\end_inset

 results in the formula of a line, as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

where the axes are 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\ln D$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x=T^{-1},$
\end_inset

 the slope is 
\begin_inset Formula $m=-Q/R$
\end_inset

 and the intercept is 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\ln D_{o}$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, the slope is given by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These relationships are represented schematically in Figure A.
 It should be noted that diffusion data are more commonly plotted on base-10
 
\begin_inset Formula $\log D$

You can read about the original experiment for yourself in the reference

 expansion (using a high-accuracy dilatometer) and sub-microscopic/lattice
 spacing changes (using in situ X-ray diffraction) on a single crystal specimen
 of an fcc metal during controlled heating.
 This may seem like a circular argument, but we already anticipate that
 the vacancy concentration will increase with temperature (see equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 So the procedure involved intrepid experimenters willing to go to high

First we see a vacancy added to one of the close-packed planes in the fcc
 structure.
 We anticipate that the average lattice spacing would change (possibly decreasin
g), but in the end this influence ends up being factored out.
 The second effect has to do with the fact that vacancies can only be added
 at surfaces, as shown.
 Given enough vacancies, however, this will amount to extra planes being
 added to the crystal.
 This should be reflected in the dilatometer measurements, if we are able
 to measure very small strains.
 So whereas the change in lattice parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta a/a$
\end_inset

, will be reflected in both X-ray diffraction or XRD (see the schematic
 of X-rays diffracting from the planes in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) and in dilatometry, the increase in the number of planes owing to vacancy
 formation (
\begin_inset Formula $(\varDelta L/L)_{planes}$
\end_inset

) will only be reflected in dilatometry.
 What we need to do is relate a uniaxial (1D) length change to the overall
 volume change (3D).
 Turning to Figure

A first observation is that both quantities (
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta L/L$
\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta a/a$
\end_inset

) increase significantly with temperature, much more than can be explained
 by the addition of vacancies, and that both are concave upward with temperature.
 In fact, both quantities are reflecting the fact that thermal expansion
 is occurring with increasing temperature.
 This might seem to be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deal-breaker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at first, until you realize that thermal expansion should be reflected
 identically in both quantities (dilatometry, XRD).
 Therefore, as per equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SimmonsBalluffi3"

\end_inset

, any thermal expansion-induced changes will cancel out.
 A second observation is that up to an onset temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{onset}$
\end_inset

) there is no apparent difference in the two quantities.
 Actually there should be a difference at every temperature (as long as
 the vacancy concentration is in thermal equilibrium) however, below 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{onset}$
\end_inset

 the vacancy concentration is simply too small to be registered, meaning
 that any difference will be undetectable within the experimental limits
 of the two measurement methods.
 Above 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{onset}$
\end_inset

, however, there is a noticeable difference between (
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta L/L$
\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta a/a$
\end_inset

), whose value is precisely one-third the vacancy concentration.
 It is obvious that the vacancy concentration increase monotonically with
 temperature up to the melting point.

Vacancy Formation in fcc Metals

Some Important Numbers and a Useful Relationship Regarding Vacancy Formation
 in fcc Metals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have the ability to establish equilibrium vacancy concentrations
 in metals, we can derive useful relationships, for example between the
 enthalpies of vacancy formation and the melting points of fcc metals.
 It turns out experimentally that the equilibrium vacancy concentrations
 at the melting points of fcc metals are almost always in the range, 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}\apprle X_{V}(T_{m})\lesssim10^{-3}$
\end_inset

.
 Let's plug this range of values into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SiteFracVacs"

\end_inset

 and assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta S_{v}\approx2.3R$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(2.3R/R)\approx10.$
\end_inset

 This yields equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:VacsAtMeltPoint"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
10^{-4}-10^{-3}\approx10\exp\left(\frac{-\varDelta H_{v}}{RT_{m}}\right)\label{eq:VacsAtMeltPoint}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
from which it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $9.2RT_{m}\lesssim\varDelta H_{v}\lesssim11.5RT_{m}$
\end_inset

, or approximately equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:VacsAtMeltPointShortcut"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varDelta H_{v}(fcc)\approx10RT_{m}\label{eq:VacsAtMeltPointShortcut}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rough estimate can come in quite handy, for example when you know the
 melting point of an fcc metal, but lack a readily available measured value
 for the enthalpy of vacancy formation.
 In addition, knowing that vacancy concentrations of fcc metals are on the
 order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}$
\end_inset

to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

at their melting points is also good to put to memory.

The Classic Bauerle and Kohler Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have good evidence for the existence of point defects like vacancies,
 but is there evidence for their motion? We can certainly argue 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the basis of tracer diffusion experiments.
 However, this question was answered in another way by Bauerle and Kohler
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "bauerle_quenched-lattice_1957"

\end_inset

.
 This experiment is a bit more difficult to describe, but following the
 development will pay dividends.
 Since the experiment involved the use of electrical resistivity measurements,
 we need to introduce what is referred to as Matthiessen's rule, given by
 equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Matthiessen"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho=\rho_{t}+\rho_{v}+\rho_{d}\label{eq:Matthiessen}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the total resistivity of a metal is shown to be governed by several
 electron-scattering mechanisms, including thermal vibrations (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}$
\end_inset

), scattering by vacancies (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{v}$
\end_inset

), and scattering by other defects like dislocations (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{d}$
\end_inset

).
 Since the resistivity of metals tends to be quite low, Bauerle and Kohler
 employed wires (to enhance the 
\lang american
measurable
\lang english
 resistance, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho l/A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $l$

A wire of fcc metal was heated to what we will refer to as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quench temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{q}$
\end_inset

) in order to set the equilibrium vacancy concentration for that temperature.
 In two separate experiments, the wire was heated and held at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{q}$
\end_inset

 and then quenched to room temperature, freezing in the equilibrium vacancy
 concentration of the quench temperature, or 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{v}(T_{q})$
\end_inset

.
 After electrical measurement at room temperature, the same wire was heated
 and held at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{q}$
\end_inset

 and then slow-cooled to room temperature.
 This second process allows for vacancy annihilation to take place, such
 that the resulting vacancy concentration is negligibly small.
 By subtracting the wire's resistivity slow-cooled (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{sc}$
\end_inset

) from that quenched (
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{q}$
\end_inset

), we find equation :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varDelta\rho=\rho_{q}-\rho_{sc}=(\rho_{t}+\rho_{v}+\rho_{d})-(\rho_{t}+\rho_{d})=\rho_{v}=\alpha X_{v}(T_{q})\label{eq:Matthiessen2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are assuming that there are no changes in the other defects (including
 dislocations) during quenching vs.
 slow cooling, and that the thermal contribution to resistivity will be
 the same, since both measurements are made at room temperature.
 The thermal and other defect contributions therefore cancel, leaving only
 the vacancy scattering contribution, which we can set equal to a constant
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) times the vacancy concentration frozen-in from the quench temperature
 [
\begin_inset Formula $X_{v}(T_{q})$
\end_inset

], as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Matthiessen2"

\end_inset

.
 This gives us something proportional to the equilibrium vacancy concentration
 at only one quench temperature, so Bauerle and Kohler repeated the procedure
 in Figure at several other quench temperatures.
 They then plotted the natural logarithm of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta\rho(T_{q})$
\end_inset

 vs.
 the inverse of quench temperature in Arrhenius fashion, as shown schematically
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BauerleKohler2"

\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a constant that does not change with quench temperature, the slope of
 the plot should reflect only the activation energy for vacancy formation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta H_{v}$
\end_inset

, as shown in the Figure.

The result obtained for fcc gold by Bauerle and Kohler was 
\begin_inset Formula $94.6kJ/mole$

 or 0.98 eV, in excellent agreement with later work of Simmons and Balluffi
 by dilatometry/XRD (
\begin_inset Formula $90.7kJ/mole$
\end_inset

 or 0.94 eV).
 We should stress that since the quench-resistivity method only yields a
 quantity that is proportional to the vacancy concentration as opposed to
 the vacancy concentration itself (as in the dilatometry/XRD work), it is
 impossible to extract information regarding the pre-exponential factor
 and underlying entropic term by quench-resistivity method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real advantage of the Bauerle-Kohler method, however, is that in addition
 to the enthalpy of vacancy formation, the enthalpy of vacancy motion can
 also be determined.
 To appreciate how this is done, we have to resurrect an old equation for
 the relaxation of vacancies, namely equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 repeated here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
You will recall this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diffusion out of a slab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 equation that we also employed to describe vacancy relaxation to sinks
 such as dislocations or grain boundaries.
 It is valid when the average composition relaxes to below 80% of the initial
 composition.
 In the present situation (quench-resistivity measurements) we can modify
 this equation to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{X_{v}}$

Bauerle and Kohler began by setting a high initial concentration of quenched-in
 vacancies, by quenching from

 to room temperature, where the initial value of

\end_inset

was measured.
 Remember that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta\rho$
\end_inset

 is always the as-quenched resistivity minus the slow-cooled resistivity.
 They then proceeded to take the wire to a relatively low intermediate temperatu
re, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{relax1}$
\end_inset

, high enough to facilitate vacancy relaxation to sinks, but not so high
 that a significant fraction of the residual vacancies are lost.
 This involved a series of sub-experiments: 1) heat at 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{relax1}$
\end_inset

 for a set time, 2) quench to room temperature, and 3) measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\varDelta\rho(t_{1})$

It turns out that the normalized self-diffusion activation energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{SD}/RT_{m}$
\end_inset

, is roughly constant for each type of crystal structure (including ceramics
 in addition to metals), however there is a different normalization factor
 for each structure type.
 It would pay to do a literature search for the appropriate relationship
 when exploring a solid with a crystal structure new to you.

This is also a good chance to introduce the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

homologous temperature,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is defined as the fraction of an element's melting temperature on
 an absolute temperature scale.
 You will encounter this a lot when dealing with kinetic phenomena in materials.
 For example, the two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intermediate
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 temperatures employed for vacancy relaxation in quenched gold, represented
 schematically as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$

in Figures

 were 
\begin_inset Formula $40^{o}C$

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $313K$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $333K$
\end_inset

 on the absolute temperature scale.
 These temperatures are 25.4% and 27.0% of the melting temperature of gold.
 Were we to make similar measurements on a different fcc metal, a good guess
 for relaxation temperatures would be to start with the same homologous
 temperatures of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.254\lesssim(T/T_{m})\lesssim0.270$

.

\begin_layout Standard
One last useful number to keep in mind is the melting point diffusivity
 of solid fcc metals.
 From the fact we were just given, namely that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{SD}/RT_{m}\approx18$
\end_inset

, we can exponentiate as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\exp\left(\frac{-Q_{SD}}{RT_{m}}\right)\approx\exp(-18)=1.8x10^{-8}\label{eq:SelfDiffMeltPt-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may recall that we employed a range of pre-exponential values for fcc
 metals, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $0.018cm^{2}/s\lesssim D_{Ao}\lesssim1.8\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/s}$
\end_inset

.
 If we arbitrarily choose a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/s}$
\end_inset

, this means that the melting point diffusivity of fcc metals should be
 on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/s}$
\end_inset

, which is in fact quite common experimentally.
 This number, 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}(T_{m},fcc)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}/s}$
\end_inset

, is therefore a good one to put to memory.

\begin_layout Standard
Many properties/functions of ionic solids/ceramics are governed by their
 point defect structures, including ionic diffusivity and ionic charge transport
/conductivity.
 However, in order to understand defect-related structure-property relationships
 we need first to master the notation now near universally employed to describe
 point defects, their formation reactions, and their point defect equilibria--ot

point defect chemistry.

 The particular notation employed is referred to as

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
A helpful shorthand scheme for Kröger-Vink (K-V) notation is given in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 An easy way to recall this shorthand scheme is by remembering it as the
 M, S and C in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Materials SCience.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 stands for matter, or the lack thereof (for example a vacancy).
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 stands for the site on which the defect sits.
 And the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 stands for charge.
 However, in K-V notation the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not real charge (as on the individual ions), but rather effective charge,
 namely the charge of a defect species relative to the perfect crystal.
 How these all work can best be illustrated by considering a number of examples.

Let's begin by considering host species and fully-charged point defects
 in zirconia, 
\begin_inset Formula $ZrO_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Before we start, it is useful to consider the real charges on the ions
 with which we are dealing.
 We can write the formula unit of 
\begin_inset Formula $ZrO_{2}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}O_{2}^{2-}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we can write the host cation species as 
\begin_inset Formula $(Zr_{Zr^{4+}}^{4+})^{x}$
\end_inset

, where the superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 represents a neutral species insofar as effective charge is concerned.
 That is, the perfect (non-defective) crystal is charge-neutral.
 What we have written is that a 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

 cation on a host 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

site has an effective charge of zero (represented by the superscript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in K-V notation.
 Similarly, we can write the host anion species as 
\begin_inset Formula $(O_{O^{2-}}^{2-})^{x}$
\end_inset

, representing an 
\begin_inset Formula $O^{2-}$
\end_inset

 host anion on an 
\begin_inset Formula $O^{2-}$
\end_inset

 site, with neutral effective charge.
 For a while we will continue to write host and defect species with real
 charge inside the parentheses, however this practice not part of the K-V
 system, but only a temporary 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

crutch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to help get us comfortable with the notation scheme.
 In K-V notation, the host species we have thus far considered would be,
 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr_{Zr}^{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{O}^{x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what about point defects? Let's first consider oxygen defects, both
 vacancies and interstitials.
 Oxygen vacancies could be written as, 
\begin_inset Formula $(V_{O^{2-}}^{0-})^{\text{••}}$
\end_inset

, representing a vacancy with zero real charge on an oxygen 2- site.
 The effective charge is thus +2, represented by the double-dots.
 Another way to think about this is to begin with a charge-neutral occupied
 oxygen site and remove from it (and the perfect crystal) an 
\begin_inset Formula $O^{2-}$
\end_inset

species.
 Since the crystal began electrically neutral, what remains must be doubly-charg
ed positive.
 How about oxygen interstitials? Remember that, as opposed to close-packed
 metals where self-interstitials are energetically unfavorable, self-interstitia
ls of cations or anions in ionic crystals are quite possible so long as
 the ionic radius of the interstitial species is close to that of the interstice
 on which it resides.
 We can write an oxygen anion interstitial as, 
\begin_inset Formula $(O_{i^{0-}}^{2-})''$
\end_inset

, which represents a doubly-charged oxygen anion on an originally uncharged
 interstice.
 The effective charge is doubly-negative, as represented by the double-strike
 marks.
 Another way to think about this is to insert a doubly-charged negative
 ion in an empty interstice in an otherwise neutral crystal.
 The effective charge should be doubly-negative.
 In K-V notation, these two species would be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{O}^{\text{••}}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $O_{i}^{''}$
\end_inset

 for vacancy and interstitial, respectively.
 Are you beginning to get the overall idea?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's test out our understanding by considering cation defects.
 A cation vacancy would be 
\begin_inset Formula $(V{}_{Zr^{4+}}^{0+})''''$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{Zr}^{''''}$
\end_inset

 in K-V notation.
 Again, you can think of this as removing a a 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

cation from an otherwise neutral crystal.
 What is left behind must have a quadruply-charged positive effective charge.
 Note that instead of a superscript of (4'), K-V writes the effective charge
 in terms of quadruple-strike marks.
 Similarly, a cation interstitial would be 
\begin_inset Formula $(Zr_{i^{0+}}^{4+})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr_{i}^{••••}$
\end_inset

 in K-V-notation.
 Again, you can think of this as inserting a 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

 cation in an empty interstice in an otherwise neutral crystal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's consider donor and acceptor doping.
 For example, let's put a 5-valent tungsten cation on a 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

site.
 We could represent this as 
\begin_inset Formula $(W_{Zr^{4+}}^{5+})^{\text{•}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{Zr}^{\text{•}}$
\end_inset

 in K-V notation.
 The fact that this is a donor is obvious from its positive effective charge.
 If we compensated for this doping by electronic species, we would have
 to chose electrons over electron holes.
 We will consider their K-V representation shortly.
 Now, consider putting a 2-valent calcium ion on a 
\begin_inset Formula $Zr^{4+}$
\end_inset

 site.
 We could represent this as 
\begin_inset Formula $(Ca_{Zr^{4+}}^{2+})^{''}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Ca_{Zr}^{\text{''}}$
\end_inset

 in K-V notation.
 The fact that this is an acceptor is obvious from its negative effective
 charge.
 If we compensated by electronic species, we would have to chose electron
 holes over electrons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, how do we represent those electronic species--electrons and holes.
 Electrons have the following notation in K-V: 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{'}$
\end_inset

.
 And electron holes have the following notation in K-V: 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{\text{•}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that in neither symbol is there a subscript.
 This is because electrons and holes do not belong to specific sites, but
 rather to the crystal at large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we are now equipped to begin writing balanced point defect reaction equations
 and mass-action relationships.
 But there is one caveat that must be made.
 In most cases the concentration of a specific species is indicated by putting
 a set of brackets around the particular species.
 For example, the concentration of oxygen vacancies and zirconium cation
 interstitials would be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{O}^{\text{••}}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[Zr_{i}^{••••}]$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 However, there is a special practice for the electronic species, namely
 that the concentrations of electrons and holes are represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, respectively, rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $[e^{'}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[h^{\text{•}}]$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\cdot$
\end_inset

But this is easy to remember, since you are probably aware of n-type vs.
 p-type behavior in donor-doped vs.
 acceptor-doped semiconductors.

\begin_layout Subsection
Rules for Balancing Point Defect Reactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Kröger-Vink rules for writing balanced point defect reactions can also
 be made to play off the M, S and C in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Materials SCience, as shown in Figure KV2.
 Here 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to mass-balance, namely that the mass on the left of a reaction
 must equal the mass on the right.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stands for charge-balance, meaning that the charge on the left side of
 a reaction must equal the charge on the right.
 It should be stressed that the charge need not be zero for this to hold;
 both sides may have net effective charge, as long as that charge is the
 same both before and after the reaction proceeds.
 Finally, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stands for site ratio and not site-balance.
 What this means is that sites need not be balanced.
 In fact, we can create sites with our reaction, as long as we preserve
 the site ratio of the host.
 For example, if we create two cation sites in a reaction involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Al_{2}O_{3}}$
\end_inset

 as the host, as long as we simultaneously create three oxygen sites, preserving
 the 2:3 ratio of cation:anion sites, we will satisfy this rule.
 It is best to learn and apply these rules by writing some actual balanced
 point defect reactions, which we do in the following sections.

Stoichiometric Point Defect Reactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In what follows three important distinctions must be made: 1) between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defects, 2) between stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric point defect
 reactions, and 3) between homogeneous and inhomogeneous point defect reactions.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we mean that the reactions involve only species that are part of the undoped
 host crystal.
 You can think of the defects as being generated from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

within.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defects come from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

without,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for example dopant species.
 The following two sections on stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric point
 defect reactions involve 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 point defects exclusively.
 In the third section, we consider doping and are therefore dealing with
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 point defects.
 Stoichiometric point defect reactions preserve the stoichiometry of the
 host, namely the O:M ratio in an oxide, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{x}O_{y}$
\end_inset

, will be preserved at fixed y/x throughout the reaction.
 In non-stoichiometric point defect reactions (dealt with in the following
 section), the O:M ratio will be shifted from y/x(stoichiometric).
 The third distinction involves homogeneous vs.
 inhomogeneous point defect reactions.
 Homogeneous point defect reactions can take place anywhere throughout the
 crystal, and do not require surfaces to act as a source/sink for defects.
 No point defect gradients are generated between surface and bulk.
 On the other hand, inhomogeneous point defect reactions require a surface
 to act as a source/sink.
 Furthermore, as they occur a gradient of point defects is generated between
 the surface and the bulk.
 They also tend to be relatively slow vis-a-vis homogeneous reactions, which
 can take place at any point in the crystal, and no migration to/from a
 surface source/sink is required.
 This may seem confusing right now, but the distinction will be made clear
 as we consider specific cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first stoichiometric reaction involves the formation of vacancy/interstitial
 pairs in what are known as Frenkel point defect reactions.
 These can be either cation Frenkel or anion Frenkel pairs.
 For sake of simplicity, we will consider all the point defect reactions
 of the present section as taking place in the M-monoxide host, MO or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{M^{2+}O^{2-}}$
\end_inset

.
 I strongly suggest putting the host above the double arrows representing
 the reaction equilibrium in every case to remind yourself of the host you
 are dealing with.
 The first reaction involves cation Frenkel pair formation, as per equation

The species within the parenthesis stands for an unoccupied interstitial
 site.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Charge Balance

\begin_layout Enumerate

Site Ratio
\series default
: Since there is one cation site on the left and one cation site on the
 right, there is no change in site ratio; the reaction satisfies the site-ratio
 rule.
 You might question the appearance of the interstice on the right, whereas
 there is no interstice on the left.
 However, site ratio pertains strictly to the normal host sites, and the
 availability of unoccupied interstices (as expressed in the equation )
 is understood.
 So this is a balanced K-V point defect reaction.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FrenkelHomog"

\end_inset

, the reaction simply involves a metal cation jumping from a normal host
 site into an ever-present empty interstice.
 This can occur everywhere homogeneously throughout the crystal, as shown,
 and does not require the presence of a surface to serve as source/sink.
 As a result, there will be no gradient of defect population between the
 surface and bulk of the crystal.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The corresponding oxygen interstitial reaction can be written as equation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
O_{O}^{x}\stackrel{MO}{\rightleftarrows}O_{i}^{\text{\prime\prime}}+V_{O}^{••}\label{eq:AnionFrenkel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, we can test this equation against the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{S}^{C}$
\end_inset

 rules.
 There is one oxygen species on either side, so mass-balance is obeyed.
 There is zero effective charge on either side, so charge-balance in achieved.
 Finally, there is one anion site on either side, so site-balance is maintained.
 This is once again a balanced K-V point defect reaction.
 Of course, the empty interstitial on the left side of the reaction is understoo
d.
 As with the cation Frenkel reaction, the anion Frenkel reaction can occur
 homogeneously throughout the crystal, as represented schematically in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FrenkelHomog"

\end_inset

.
 So oxygen Frenkel pair formation is a homogeneous point defect reaction.
 One final very important point should be made.
 Whereas the cation Frenkel reaction will vary with host crystal stoichiometry,
 namely the aluminum interstitial in 
\begin_inset Formula $Al_{2}O_{3}$
\end_inset

will be trivalent (
\begin_inset Formula $Al_{i}^{•••}$
\end_inset

) as will the vacancy left behind (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{Al}^{'''}$
\end_inset

), the anion Frenkel reaction is universal to all oxides.
 In other words, the identical reaction as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

At first glance this seems like an incomplete reaction.
 There is no mass present, and what the heck is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

null?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, believe it or not this is, in fact, a balanced K-V point defect reaction.
 There is no mass on either side, so mass balance is maintained.
 Both sides are charge-neutral (the 2+ and 2- on the right side cancel),
 so charge balance is preserved.
 But what about the fact that there are no sites on the left, whereas there
 are two on the right? The site-ratio rule does not prohibit the formation
 or annihilation of sites, but rather specifies that if formed or annihilated,
 this must be done in the stoichiometric ratio of the host.
 In this case we create anion and cation sites in the requisite 1:1 ratio

Let's move a bulk oxygen species to the surface, as shown, making it a surface
 anion and turning the underlying M surface species into a bulk cation.
 Next move a bulk metal species to the surface, as shown, making it a surface
 cation and turning the underlying O surface species into a bulk O species.
 By these two sub-steps, two vacancies are formed, one cationic and one
 anionic.
 The net point defect reaction can be written as equation :

 However, the exercise has been an important one, since pairs of vacancies
 cannot arbitrarily form in the bulk of a crystal.
 Instead, Schottky pairs must be formed at surfaces and then migrate into
 the interior of the crystal, as shown in Figure

Two additional caveats must be made, however.
 Grain boundaries and dislocation cores can also serve as internal surfaces

In addition to Frenkel and Schottky defect reactions, there are two additional
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stoichiometric

\end_inset

 point defect reactions.
 The first involves site-exchange.
 For example, in the spinel 
\begin_inset Formula $MgAl_{2}O_{4}$
\end_inset

 there are two different coordination environments for cations.
 The Mg cations reside on tetrahedral sites, meaning that they are bonded
 to four oxygen anions.
 The Al cations reside on octahedral sites, meaning that they are bonded
 to six oxygen anions.
 However, at elevated temperature the two cations can switch sites, as represent
ed by the following equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with Frenkel reactions, this exchange need not take place only at surfaces,
 since the two cations are only changing places.
 Hence, such cation exchange reactions are homogeneous in nature.
 Once again, we can test whether or not this equation is balanced in terms
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{S}^{C}$
\end_inset

 rules.
 There is one Mg species and one Al species on each side, so the equation
 is mass-balanced.
 There is one tetrahedral site and one octahedral site on each side, so
 the equation preserves site balance.
 In this case, the site ratio is O:Al:Mg equal to 4:2:1.
 Finally, both sides are charge-neutral.
 This is a balanced K-V reaction.

So we have considered four different cases of stoichiometric point defect
 reactions, namely those that result in no change of the overall stoichiometry
 of the host.
 The ratio of O:M is maintained by each such reaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-stoichiometric Point Defect Reactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can divide non-stoichiometric point defect reactions into two categories,
 namely 1) those that decrease the O:M ratio, otherwise known as reduction
 reactions, and 2) those that increase the O:M ratio, otherwise known as
 oxidation reactions.
 As we will show, the former always produce electrons for charge-compensation
 and are n-type in nature, whereas the latter always produce electron hole
 for charge-compensation and are p-type in nature.
 Let's first consider reduction/n-type point defect reactions.
 Since oxygen gas either is produced (reduction reactions) or consumed (oxidatio
n reactions) and this can only take place at surfaces, all non-stoichiometric
 point defect reactions are inhomogeneous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can decrease the O:M ratio by either decreasing the oxygen content or
 by increasing the cation content.
 Both are accomplished by the removal of oxygen, resulting in oxygen gas
 being released, plus the simultaneous production of electrons.

\begin_layout Standard
This is probably unnecessary at this point, but to keep you in the practice
 of checking off the

 rules, it can be seen that 1) there is one oxygen species on each side
 of the equation, 2) both sides are charge-neutral, and 3) we started with
 one anion site and end up with one anion site such that site-ratio is preserved.
 This is a balanced K-V reaction.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Aliovalent Doping Reactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider how the oxide, MO, might be aliovalently-doped.
 Isovalent doping would be doping MO with oxide NO, where the valence state
 of the species N is 2+, as it is in the MO host.
 Aliovalent doping means doping with oxides having cations of different
 prevailing valence states than the host.
 We can write reactions for donor-doping, where the doping cation has a
 higher valence state than 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{2+},$
\end_inset

 and for acceptor-doping, where the doping cation has a lower valence state
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{2+}$
\end_inset

.
 In each case we can charge-compensate with ionic point defects or with
 electronic defects.
 For example, let's consider donor-doping of MO with the trivalent cation
 N, or 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}O_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The ionic compensation reaction involves the formation of cation vacancies,
 as per equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a good reaction on which to test your K-V balancing skills.
 The reaction is obviously mass-balanced and charge-balanced, but what about
 site-ratio? Well, the reaction yields 3 anion sites and 3 cation sites,
 which are created in precisely the O:M ratio of the host (3:3 equals 1:1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The alternative to ionic compensation is electronic compensation.
 Note that in so doing, we need to release some of the oxygen as gas to
 maintain the M:O ratio of the host.
 The resulting reaction is given by equation

\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}O$

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An obvious question to ask is which compensation mechanism (ionic, electronic)
 will take place in a certain dopant oxide/host oxide combination? The answer
 is that it depends upon the defect formation energetics, which we consider
 in the following section.
 You may also have missed a critical changeover from the previous two sections
 on stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric reactions to the present one on
 aliovalent doping reactions.
 You will notice forward and reverse arrows in the reactions of the prior
 two sections, but only a forward arrow in the reactions of the present
 section.
 This is owing to the fact that the first two sections dealt with equilibrium
 point defect reactions, meaning that the forward and reverse arrows were
 balanced.
 With aliovalent doping of ceramics, this is not the case, unless one has
 excess dopant oxide present at high temperature, namely a two-phase mixture.
 Instead, ceramics are donor-doped and acceptor-doped by incorporating a
 fixed amount of aliovalent dopant in the initial processing of the doped
 host ceramic.
 It is expected that the forward reaction goes to completion during processing
 at elevated temperature.
 Therefore, there is only a forward arrow.
 In other words, in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DonorIonic"

\end_inset

 for example, we can set the vacancy concentration equal to one-half the
 trivalent donor concentration, or 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{M}^{''}]=\frac{1}{2}[N_{M}^{\text{•}}].$
\end_inset

 It should be quite clear that all doping reactions, whether isovalent or
 aliovalent are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

extrinsic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reactions, since the dopant species comes from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

outside
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the host crystal.
 It should also be clear that all doping reactions are inhomogeneous, reflecting
 the fact that dopants react with the surfaces of host oxide crystals/particles
 and undergo what is referred to as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

solid state reaction
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_inset

Brouwer diagrams
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Phillips Res.
 Rep., 9, 366).
 Brouwer diagrams are logarithmic plots of defect populations 1) vs.
 temperature (or rather inverse temperature), 2) vs.
 oxygen partial pressure, or 3) vs.
 dopant concentration, again on a logarithmic scale.
 We consider schematic versions for each of these in the following sections.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Brouwer Diagrams of Defect Concentration vs.
 Inverse Temperature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This type of diagram is useful for determining the energetics of point defect
 formation and motion in ionic solids/ceramics.
 For example, consider the extrinsic doping of NaCl by 
\begin_inset Formula $CaCl_{2}$
\end_inset

, where Ca is divalent (
\begin_inset Formula $Ca^{2+}Cl_{2}^{-}$
\end_inset

), as given by equation

\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to write what is commonly called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

electroneutrality condition,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which we will henceforth refer to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ENC.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This condition is required to maintain the overall electroneutrality of
 the host crystal.
 The ENC is a straightforward expression setting the sum of all the negatively-c
harged point defects equal to the sum of all the positively-charged point
 defects, as per equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CaCl2inNaClENC"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
[V_{Na}^{'}]=[Ca_{Na}^{\text{•}}]+[V_{Cl}^{\text{•}}]\label{eq:CaCl2inNaClENC}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to make so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Brouwer approximations.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 These are regimes in which two species--one positively charged and one
 negatively charged--predominate.
 As we consider equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CaCl2inNaClENC"

\end_inset

, it is clear that there should be two such regimes: 1) one where the Na-vacancy
 concentration is set by the Ca-donor doping, or 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Na}^{'}]=[Ca_{Na}^{\text{•}}]$
\end_inset

, and 2) one where the Na-vacancy concentration is determined by the Schottky
 equilibrium with Cl-vacancies, or 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Na}^{'}]=[V_{Cl}^{\text{•}}]$
\end_inset

.
 But which regime will be on the left and which will be on the right on
 a log [defect] vs.
 inverse temperature plot? Since temperature increases from right to left
 on plot with an inverse temperature (1/T) x-axis, it makes sense that the
 extrinsic, donor-doped regime would dominate at low temperatures, or to
 the right, whereas intrinsic, Schottky pair defects would dominate at high
 temperatures, or to the left.
 The resulting schematic Brouwer diagram is given in Figure T, with the
 two Brouwer approximations/regimes clearly marked.

The slope of the Na-vacancy concentration (important for later) is marked
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varDelta H_{S}/2R$
\end_inset

.
 This follows from inserting the ENC for that regime, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Na}^{'}]=[V_{Cl}^{\text{•}}]$
\end_inset

, into the equilibrium expression of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SchottkyEq2-1"

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{S}=[V_{Na}^{'}]^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Na}^{'}]=K_{S}^{1/2}$
\end_inset

and that the activation energy for this regime will be 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varDelta H_{S}/2R$
\end_inset

.
 However, the diagram isn't complete until we show a line for each species
 in both regimes.
 The donor-dopant, , is easy.
 It is just a horizontal line extending from the extrinsic regime into the
 intrinsic regime as shown.
 The Ca-dopant is a minority species in this regime.
 So we have lines for each of the three species in the ENC of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CaCl2inNaClENC"

\end_inset

 in the intrinsic regime.
 But what about the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Cl}^{\text{•}}]$
\end_inset

 in the extrinsic regime? Well, we know its concentration at the dashed
 line demarking the transition between electroneutrality regimes.
 In the extrinsic regime, the concentration of Na-vacancies is fixed by
 the aliovalent dopant concentration, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Na}^{'}]=[Ca_{Na}^{\text{•}}]=$
\end_inset

constant (not a function of temperature).
 This means from the equilibrium expression of equation that Cl-vacancy
 concentration will be directly proportional to the Schottky formation constant,
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $[V_{Cl}^{\text{•}}]=K_{S}/[V_{Na}^{'}]=K_{S}/[Ca_{Na}^{\text{•}}]=K_{S}/constant$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the slope on the Cl-vacancy concentration in the extrinsic regime
 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varDelta H_{S}/R$
\end_inset

, as shown.

\begin_layout Standard
Based upon the Brouwer diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NaClInverseTBrouw"

\end_inset

, we know that there is no energy of formation of Na-vacancies in the extrinsic
 regime; the slope is attributable solely to the enthalpy of motion, or
 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varDelta H_{mv}/R$
\end_inset

.
 However, in the extrinsic regime there are contributions from both the
 enthalpy of motion and the enthalpy of formation.
 From the Brouwer diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:NaClInverseTBrouw"

\end_inset

, we know that the contribution from formation is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\varDelta H_{S}/2R$
\end_inset

, so the combined slope is 
\begin_inset Formula $-(\varDelta H_{mv}+\varDelta H_{S}/2)/R$
\end_inset

.
 Since we know the enthalpy of motion from the slope of the diffusion plot
 in the extrinsic regime, this means that we can now calculate the enthalpy
 of Schottky pair formation from the slope of the diffusion plot in the
 intrinsic regime.
 This demonstrates the power of Brouwer diagrams for the study of point
 defect formation and motion in ionic solids/ceramics.

 the reduction reaction of equation

, two electrons are formed for each oxygen vacancy formed.
 Hence, the electron population should be twice the concentration of oxygen
 vacancies.
 Were these the prevailing species, the Brouwer approximation would be 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2[V_{O}^{••}]$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based upon the overall ENC, it would seem that there should be four Brouwer

\begin_inset Formula $n=2[V_{O}^{••}]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $2[V_{M}^{''}]=2[V_{O}^{••}]$

 Instead, the oxide in question will either have ionic species dominating

Dividing both sides by 3, it follows that

 The slopes of the electrons and electron holes in the central regime follows
 from consideration of oxidation and reduction reactions.
 For example, reorganizing the reduction reaction of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is constant in the middle regime, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\log n/\partial\log p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

will be -1/4.
 Hence the -1/4 slope in the middle regime.
 For all other species, one can play off the corresponding majority defect
 to establish individual slopes.
 For example, from the intrinsic electronic disorder reaction of equation

\end_inset

to the -1/6 power, the electron hole population must vary with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 to the +1/6 power.
 Similarly, from the Schottky pair formation reaction of

\begin_inset Formula $K_{S}=[V_{M}^{''}][V_{O}^{••}]$

 It can be seen that in this regime the ionic defects (cation vacancies

 Brouwer diagrams have limited practical application, owing to two facts.
 First, few oxides are amphoteric, meaning that they exhibit both n-type
 and p-type behavior.
 Most go in one direction (oxidation or reduction, p-type or n-type), but
 seldom both.
 Second, few oxides are employed in an undoped intrinsic state.
 We will discuss additional log[defect] vs.

A very useful type of Brouwer diagram involves plots of defect populations
 vs.
 dopant concentration (at fixed T and

 As with the log[defect] vs.
 inverse temperature plots already discussed, these have two Brouwer approximati

 The procedures for creating such Brouwer diagrams are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Write the appropriate intrinsic point defect reaction and the corresponding
 mass-action (equilibrium constant) equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 regime should fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Let's start by considering cation-deficit oxide MO, which is known to be
 a p-type semiconductor under oxidizing conditions.
 It is known that it can be acceptor-doped by the oxide,

\end_inset

, where the dopant is monovalent, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}^{+}O^{2-}$
\end_inset

, resulting in electronic compensation by electron holes.
 The intrinsic point defect reaction is the oxidation reaction to form cation
 vacancies, as in equation

The next task is to decide on which side of the Brouwer diagram to place
 the extrinsic regime.
 This is pretty straightforward in the present case, owing to the fact that
 with increasing donor-doping, extrinsic behavior should

\end_inset

 In the intrinsic regime, the Brouwer approximation is given by

However, since temperature (and therefore

 also be fixed (
\begin_inset Formula $p=2[V_{M}^{''}]$
\end_inset

 It can be seen that all three defect species (
\begin_inset Formula $p,[V_{M}^{''}],[N_{M}^{'}]$
\end_inset

 how the metal vacancy concentration varies with doping level in the extrinsic
 regime.
 Rearranging equation

 and substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $[N_{M}^{'}]$

We can also create a log[defect] vs.

 Again, we need to decide where the extrinsic regime belongs, on the left
 or on the right.
 This is not as straightforward as with the log[defect] vs.
 log[dopant] diagram.
 However, examination of the intrinsic defect reaction of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 indicates that as the oxygen partial pressure increases, the metal vacancy
 concentration will increase.
 This suggests that the intrinsic regime should be on the right with the
 extrinsic regime on the left.
 (Hint: if you try doing it the other way around, the resulting diagram
 will not make sense.) We begin by drawing a horizontal dashed line in Figure

\begin_layout Section
Electrical Conductivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usefulness and predictive power of schematic Brouwer diagrams can best
 be illustrated by considering electrical conductivity, which is controlled
 by the point defect species with the highest product of concentration and
 mobility.
 It turns out that there can be contributions from first, electronic species
 (electrons and electron holes), and from second, mobile ionic species.
 The former determines the electronic conductivity of a solid and the second
 determines the ionic conductivity of that solid.
 Together, these two contributions determine the overall electrical conductivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Electronic Conductivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From introductory materials science and engineering courses, you should
 be familiar with the following equation for the electronic conductivity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma=ne\mu_{e}+pe\mu_{h}\label{eq:CondElectronic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is the unit of electron charge, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{e}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{h}$
\end_inset

 are the mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 are their concentrations, as previously defined.
 Usually, however, one species will dominate (as a majority species) whereas
 the other will have negligible concentration (a minority species).
 For example, electrons are majority species in the n-type semiconducting
 oxide MO, as reflected in the Brouwer diagram of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MOredPox"

\end_inset

.
 In this case, the electronic conductivity reduces to equation :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma=ne\mu_{e}\label{eq:CondElectronic-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to do a unit analysis on the parameters in this equation to
 understand common usage in the materials community.
 The basic unit of conductivity is a Sieman per centimeter, or S/cm.
 The Sieman is the same as a reciprocal ohm (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\Omega$
\end_inset

), and according to Ohm's law an ohm is voltage/current (V/I) or a Joule
 per coulomb (J/C) divided by a coulomb per second (C/s), such that an ohm
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{(J\text{\cdot\ensuremath{s)/C^{2}}}}$
\end_inset

.
 Placing these values into equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CondElectronic-1"

\end_inset

, we obtain equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ElectronicUnits"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{]\frac{C^{2}}{(J\text{\cdot}s\text{\cdot}cm)}=\frac{\#}{cm^{3}}C\mu_{e}}\label{eq:ElectronicUnits}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that the basic units for mobility are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$
\end_inset

 per V
\begin_inset Formula $\cdot$
\end_inset

s (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{cm^{2}/V\text{\cdot}s}$
\end_inset

).
 This may make more sense written as a centimeter per second (carrier velocity)
 per volt per centimeter (driving force), or 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathrm{cm/s)/(V/cm})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is where the predictive power of schematic Brouwer diagrams comes in
 handy.
 If the electronic mobility is independent of carrier concentration, then
 the conductivity in equation

\end_inset

 will depend solely upon the carrier concentration, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 Employing a highly pure titanium metal filament, which was subsequently

 G=1/R) vs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$

behavior that could be employed to monitor the oxygen content in the exhaust
 gases of the internal combustion engine.
 This enabled engineers to control the air-to-fuel ratio, otherwise known
 at the lambda-ratio.
 Hence, automotive oxygen sensors are typically referred to as lambda-sensors.
 It should be noted that given the different cation valence (4+ in 
\begin_inset Formula $TiO_{2}$

 vs.
 2+ for MO), and therefore the different charge on an interstitial cation,
 the slope on a log-log plot of G vs.

 was not the -1/6 for titania.
 Nevertheless, the invention of a resistance-based oxygen sensor was an

 The charge of the mobile species is given by

This may not look familiar, but we have previously dealt with a version
 of this equation when dealing with self diffusion by vacancy mechanism
 in metals.
 You can find it back in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SelfVacDiffComp"

\end_inset

, which can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{A}=X_{v}D_{v}$
\end_inset

.
 In reality, this expression should be 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}D_{A}=(1-X_{v})D_{A}=X_{v}D_{v}$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of metals, however, the site fraction of vacancies is negligibly
 small such that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}=(1-X_{v})\approx1$
\end_inset

.
 However, in the case of CaO-doped 
\begin_inset Formula $ZrO_{2}$
\end_inset

 the sizable vacancy content cannot be ignored.

Let's consider zirconia doped by 15 mole percent of calcia.
 The formula unit can be written as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
such that the site fractions will be 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{O}=1.85/2=0.925$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{V_{O}^{••}}=0.15/2=0.075$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the ratio of site fractions (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{O}/X_{V_{O}^{••}}$
\end_inset

) is 12.33.
 From equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CSZsiteFrac"

\end_inset

 it follows that the vacancy diffusivity at every temperature will be 12.33
 times the oxygen ion diffusivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we need to be able to do is to go back and forth between ionic conductivity
 and either of the diffusivities (oxygen, vacancy).
 If we know the concentration of overall oxygen sites, we can calculate
 the concentration of either occupied oxygen sites (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{O}c_{OS}$
\end_inset

) or of oxygen vacancies (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{V_{O}^{••}}c_{OS}$
\end_inset

).
 The concentration of overall oxygen sites can be calculated in a couple
 of ways.

There are 4 formula units or 8 oxygen sites per unit cell.
 If given the lattice parameter (

 Alternatively, we might be given the density of the the 15 mole percent-doped

 The mass per formula unit (FU) in equation

 The density (

) divided by the mass per FU (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{g}/FU$
\end_inset

) gives the number of formula units per 
\begin_inset Formula $cm^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 The number of oxygen sites per 
\begin_inset Formula $cm^{3}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{OS}$
\end_inset

) is just twice this value, since there are 2 oxygen sites per formula unit.
 Either way, we can now go back and forth between diffusivity (oxygen ion
 or oxygen vacancy) and ionic conductivity using the Nernst-Einstein relationshi

By plotting the natural logarithm of the product of ionic conductivity and
 temperature (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}T$

) vs.
 inverse temperature, we can determine the enthalpy of oxygen/vacancy motion,
 as shown in Figure

 This figure shows how to calculate individual diffusivities from the ionic
 conductivity, and vice versa.
 It should be pointed out that once one diffusivity is determined, the other
 diffusivity can be readily calculated from the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{O}D_{O}=X_{V_{O}^{••}}D_{V_{O}^{••}}$
\end_inset

 relationship.

The oxygen sensors in the internal combustion engines of gas-powered automobiles
 are zirconia-based.
 However, instead of registering conductance (resistance) vs.
 oxygen partial pressure, the zirconia sensor serves as a solid electrolyte
 membrane between two environments.
 One side is exposed to air (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}=0.21$
\end_inset

) as a reference, while the other is exposed to the hot combustion gases
 coming from the engine.
 High temperature is required to keep the ionic conductivity high enough
 for the zirconia sensor to function.
 An electrochemical voltage is produced between the two sides of the zirconia
 electrolyte that is proportional to the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{O_{2}}$
\end_inset

 between the two sides.
 When the air-to-fuel ratio is high, excess oxygen decreases the difference
 (and the voltage).
 But when the air-to-fuel ratio is low, the reducing products of combustion
 increase the difference (and the voltage).
 A micro-processor uses the output of the oxygen sensor to adjust the air-to-fue
l ratio by controlling the fuel injectors in the engine.
 You might suppose that the purpose of the oxygen sensor would be to keep
 the engine operating at optimal efficiency, but this is not the case.
 The purpose of the oxygen sensor is to maintain the air-to-fuel ratio in
 a narrow range where all three catalysts in the catalytic converter function
 optimally to react unwanted pollutants (reduction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{NO_{x}}$
\end_inset

, oxidation of CO, and oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons).
