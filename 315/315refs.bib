	abstract = {Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals \{\vphantom{\}}9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions \{\vphantom{\}}3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation \{\vphantom{\}}6); miscellaneous functions \{\vphantom{\}}9); Laplace transforms (2); and others.Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over 100 figures illustrate the text.In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work. This low-cost edition contains every page of the original government publication. Preface by A. V. Astin. Foreword by Advisory Committee, Conference on Mathematical Tables. Editors' Introduction.

The data support the postulates that, for a given crystal structure and bond type DTM = AQRT0M = B and V* = Q0T0M(dTMdp)0 where A and B are constants which, to first order, are independent of pressure, p; T0M is the meltingpoint at atmospheric pressure; and R is the gas constant. Mean values of the constants A and B, and values for V*, are evaluated for twelve crystal structures and bond types. For each such class the diffusion behaviour can be written D = Aexp - B exp - \{B {\textperiodcentered} T0MT (1 = p dTM0T0M dp)\} Such equations are useful in estimating approximate rates of transport, or creep, or sintering, in materials for which little or no diffusion data are available.},

	abstract = {The entropy of lattice defects are here considered in somewhat greater detail than previously. Calculations are out to estimate the intrinsic entropies associated with such lattice defects as interstitialcies and vacancies, and with the activated complexes of vacancy and ring diffusion. The present application is to fcc metals and a very simplified force model representing only the closed-shell, ion-core repulsions of copper has been used. The problem consists in evaluating the change of lattice vibrations with the introduction of each defect. The method is in a first approximation to consider vibrations localized around the defect as separate from elastic vibrations at appreciable distance from the defect. Only in the region far from the defect is the entropy contribution always positive. The surface condition of zero pressure introduces a term which reduces the effect of the "localized" vibrations. In general the intrinsic entropy is less positive for those configurations where there is crowding of the atoms than for those configurations where the atoms have greater free volume.},

	abstract = {Measurements of change in length and change in lattice parameter were made at identical temperatures on 99.995\% aluminum in the temperature range 229 to 656{\textdegree}C. Length changes, $\Delta$L, were measured on an unconstrained horizontal bar sample using a rigid pair of filar micrometer microscopes. X-ray lattice parameter changes, $\Delta$a, were observed using a high-angle, back-reflection, rotating-single-crystal technique. The measurements are compared to earlier work. The relative expansions $\Delta$LL and $\Delta$aa were equal within about 1:105 from 229 to 415{\textdegree}C. At higher temperatures additional atomic sites were found to be generated: the difference between the two expansions could be represented by 3($\Delta$LL-$\Delta$aa)=exp(2.4)exp(-0.76 ev/kT). At the melting point (660{\textdegree}C) the equilibrium concentration of additional sites is 3($\Delta$LL-$\Delta$aa)=9.4{\texttimes}10-4. This result is independent of the detailed nature of the defects, for example, the lattice relaxation or degree of association. The nature of the defects is considered and it is concluded that they are predominantly lattice vacancies; it is estimated that the divacancy contribution at the melting point may well be less than about 15\%, corresponding to a divacancy binding energy ? 0.25 ev. The observed formation energy agrees with the values obtained by quenching techniques and by interpretation of the high-temperature electrical resistivity of identical material by Simmons and Balluffi. The present work is the first direct measurement of formation entropy; the value is near that expected from theoretical considerations. The contribution of the thermally generated defects to other physical properties at high temperatures is considered briefly.},
